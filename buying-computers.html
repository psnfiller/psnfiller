title: Computer shopping advice
---

<p>This is computer shopping advice for my aunt in law, but its reasonably
general. It is advice for non-nerds - every nerd I know has his own
opinions.</p>

<p>
<b>If you have money to spare</b>: buy a mac. Laura has one. She got my old one, which
lasted for about five years before having a water based accident. Apple did a
good job at after sales support etc. My parents have one as well. <a

</p>


<p>
<b>If you don't have money to spare:</b> Think about a <a
  href="http://www.google.ie/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebooks.html">Chromebook</a>.
I hate to be a shrill for my employer, but the Chromebook is a pretty good
set-up. Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are pretty cheap - about 200 quid.</li>
  <li>In the event you break one, you don't lose any data.</li>
  <li>They have a much safer security model, which means less spyware etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantage is that its solely a web browser - if you can't do it in the
web now, you can't do it on a chrome book. I'm going to buy one and try it out
when I get paid again. People have been singing the praises of <a
  href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=758129031">The Samsung model</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Try out a tablet</b>: Some people do all their stuff on a tablet. Good
models are the ipad and the nexus 7. Supposed to be great for kids.
</p>

<p><b>Avoid buying a desktop.</b> Laptops take up less space, can be used from
the sofa / the coffee shop / the bed, and have a battery which protects you from
kicking the power plug out. There used to be two reasons against buying laptops:
cost, and computing power. Cost has gone away, and power only matters today if
you play new games or write code for a living.
</p>

<p><b>Forget upgrading</b>. Treat the computer as a closed box. On the one hand,
upgrades are pretty easy if you know what you are doing. On the other, opening
the case voids the warranty, and its still pretty easy to make a mistake and
break the computer forever. </p>

<p><b>Avoid Windows:</b> I find windows confusing and slow. Its also got tons of
security problems. If you do end up with a windows computer, do take backups,
run anti virus software, and so on.</p>
