I looked at installing mod_spdy on my littler server. The docs were kinda weird
in two places

To install the packages on Debian/Ubuntu, run (as root) the following commands:

dpkg -i mod-spdy-*.deb
apt-get -f install

Installing mod_spdy will add the Google repository so your system will
automatically keep mod_spdy up to date. If you don't want Google's repository,
run sudo touch /etc/default/mod-spdy before installing the package.
