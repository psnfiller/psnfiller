<p>
Quick update, mostly to let my Mum know we haven't been kidnapped. We are in San
Pedro de Atacama. The Atacama is the direst desert on Earth. We've been out for a
walk, and its not as dry as I expected - there are streams and life along the
watercourses. Of course, where there is no water, there is just dust.

</p>

<p> The journey was spectacular - massive salt flats, colourful rocks, and more
wildlife, including flamingos. We're popping back to take a closer look at the
Flamingos. The pass at the top of the Andes is 4170  meters - high enough to cause
headaches, weird tingling in the fingers, and a bit of nausea. </p>

<p> We're been out stargazing, and the town is lovely. Not much more to report. </p>
