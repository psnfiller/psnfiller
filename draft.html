title: na... Traverse
---

<p>

We are back from the na... traverse. Its been a tough six days, and now
we are completely shattered and drinking lots of water. Also everything
stinks. I have this fear we'll be kicked out the out of the hostel due
to the smell. Hers some notes on the route, which might be of use to others.
</p>

<p>
Maps and stuff: we used the lonely planet book trekking in the patagonian andes.
The times in the book are optimistic. Speculation as to why:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The Author retired from the SAS, or some other job that required running up
  hills.</li>
  <li>The Author wasn't carrying a test, food, stove, etc.</li>
  <li>The author was in the process of writing a book on patagonian treks and was therefore somewhat fitter than us </li>
  <li>The author had spent the past few years working as a mountain guide </li>

</ul>

<p> I like the first theory, though the last two have the advantage of being
true.</p>

<p>The map was kinda crappy too. Crags aren't marked. I suppose that if
you want a map with crags they start with a black bit of paper.</p>

<p> The nag was pretty easy though the trip, but mostly because we could
see the way owning to good weather. It would be a pain to do in poor
weather. </p>

<p> We drank the water from the rivers. It was lovely and freezing
cold. We often had our cups on the outside of our bags, and dipped them
into streams.  We pasted a gang of scouts singing the spanish version
of "I want to go awandering". Thats our life now. drinking water
from streams. signing kids.  green trees. Lewis and Clark wandering
past. foxes barking.  </p>

<p>

In less good water news, the folks down in CAB suggested added a drop of
bleach to each liter of water.

</p>

<p>The book claims you can get food, sleep etc in huts known as refiocos. we
shunned this options, mostly because we had the tent etc, anwe didnÂ´t fancy
booking ahread. One hears mixed reports about the quality of the palces, how
watertight they are etc.
</p>

<h3>Day One</h3>

<p> We headed up the ski lift (this is the primary route in the book)
mostly due to the parties of Argentine teenagers heading for the path
up to Frey. We were warned about the wind at the bottom. It was a
cold strong wind, but we were pretty stable on our feet when we were
up there. We did end up wearing thick gloves, balaclava, many layers
etc. Only one lift at the ski centre was operating, so we took that one
and had to figure out where we were at the top.  </p>

<p>
We did the traverse from the ridge above the ski center to the turning for
refoico frey This is mostly over shattered rock, following the dots. There
was good views over the ridge at a low point. The turn off to frey (the
left) and (Jacob the right) was drawn on a rock.

</p>

<p>
The book suggests dropping down to Frey, then climbing back up and down the
other side the next day. We shunned this option. It featured a pile more height
gain and loss, Megan (Who we had met while white water rafting) desrbied her
nightr there as a effort to hold the tent down in the wind, and we didn't fancy
hanging around with tons of teenagers.

</p>

<p>Its worth noting that the trek had quite a few parties of folk in different
levels of gear. We saw folk in trainers, without rain prtection, etc more here.
</p>

<p>
slow progress down to the vally - long scree desent. Camped in the Vally-
its a big site along the path. We didn't see anyone else that night, but
more folks showed up when we went to bed. In the evening, three dogs came
and sniffed around. No idea how they got into the park. It was pretty cold
in the valley.

</p>

<p>

<h3>Day two</h3>

This was a short day - and we had hopes for day three - we pulled out of
the end of the valley and over the pass to ref... the desert is more on
scree fleids and pretty slow. if you like walking over shattered rock, you
can do the two tops here

</p>

<p>


the refeno is nice enough

day three

</p>

<p>
foiled, we headed down the valley. this is a bit slow to get started, but
once over the birdge, we bombed it down the valley. its a nice gentle
slope. However, its longer than the book says. (the book claims 13k, and
the sign at the bottom claims 18k, and the sign is a good bit closer)

</p>

<p>

we hitched from the bottom almost o colina swise. As we walked the last
mile or so, we could hear a very long rock and roll guitar solo. This kept
on playing for ... We pitched up at a big campsite somewhat more used to
holidaying beanos aries folks than smelly hikers. I almost fainted. We ate
massive burgers and drank wine. this is the life.
</p>

<p>

day four

We were slow getting off the next day, mostlbe because we had lost
motivation. I did jump in the lake off the pier, which was fantastic. I
think we should carry swimming stuff. The campsite showers didnt work. We
ate lunch in the twon before getting back on the hoof. The walk up the
valley was hot and full of flies.
</p>

<p>

the End of the day was probably the toughest uphill of the walk - a 400m
pull up by the waterfall. slow slow progress. The Locaction of La Negra is
fanastic. camped in a hallow in the bushes. Laura shunned pasta, ate cold
pizza, and woke up at 4am in a hungur.
</p>

<p>
