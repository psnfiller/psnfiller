On Thursday, we rolled out of bed and attempted to get to El Ray National park.
Sadly, the rain was not on our side. The road to El Ray is a 47km dirt track
with many river crossings, and our guide - who was in real 4x4 - didn't fancy
doing it in the driving rain. We instead headed for his local birding spots, and
and on the way back towards Salta he demstrated the realness of his 4x4 (and the
fact it wasn't a chelsa tractor) by pulling another car out of a ditch on a
flooded road. The rescue was very agrentina - everyone stopped, and half the
local males got out, started running around in rain and the deep mud helping,
finding rope, tying it to the car and to our 4x4, and in the end pulling the car
and passengers to safety. The other half of the population lent on their horns -
we've even seen drivers toot at the cops here (The garda would find a reason to
arrest you if you did that). Final twist to the rescue was our guide producing a
crocodile dundee knife http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLS3RGesIFQ to cut the
rope off the front of his car. (final final twist - laura found a online review
of a tour near salta that descriped a mostly silent guide leading his party
deeper and deeper into the forest, slashing at vegitation as he went. I'm pretty
certain i've seen that movie).

<p>Anyway, he took was birding, both by the lake and into the forest. He was
fantasic - and we saw a lot. photos I{m happy with:</p>.
