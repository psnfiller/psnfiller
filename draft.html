title: Road trip to Cachi
---

<p> We didn't do very much on Monday - we had hopes of going to the <a
  href="http://www.maam.gob.ar/">museum</a>, but it
was closed. The Museum would defy all attempts to visit it. We did do a
pile of planning and sorting stuff out, as well as tromping up the local
hill. On Tuesday, we jumped in a hire car and took off on a road trip.
</p> <p>

We drove the southern tourist loop from Salta  - down to Cafayate, up
a smaller road to Cachi, then though Los Cardones national park back to
Salta. The lady in the tourist information office assured us we could do
this in two days, sadly, this was not the case.  </p>

<p> The road down to Cafayate is kinda boring until we got into the
desert in Quebrada de Cafayate. Once again, weird and wonderful rock
formations drawn by the wind and water. It was a lovely fast drive,
although the Salta traffic is insane.  </p>

<p> Cafayate is a lovely place. Its the second town in Argentina for
wine, and if you are looking for a place to drink wine, go there rather
than Mendoza. The local wine even comes in ice cream form!. We wandered
around for a while, drank some of the local wine (torrontes - its a lovely
white that people say is hard to get outside Argentina), ate empanadas
while drinking wine from a jug, and peeked at the local museum - tons
of pottery recovered from local archaeological digs. We were a bit pushed
for time, so we couldn't stay a day, much as we wanted to.  </p>

<p> The drive to Cachi was mostly on dirt roads. We set out zooming along
on tarmac, through wine yards, looking at wonderful mountains with the sun
blazing down. We overtook a local in his junker (one of the things that
got me when I moved to Ireland is that one sees more cars with dented
paneling etc than one does in the UK. Argentina lowers the standards
even more :-)). We promptly hit the dirt road, and crawled along at 30
kilometres a hour. The local promptly overtook us, going much the same
speed as he was doing on tarmac. We laughed.  </p>

<p>

The scenery on the drive is Fantastic. Look at the pictures!

We saw parrots, woodpeckers, a small American Kestrel and a few Crested
Caracaras among others.  </p>

We got a flat about 20 kilometers from Cachi. The car had been shaking
about so much we didn't hear it go, but a passerby tooted to let us
know. Two people who had never changed a tire before (myself and Laura,
if there is any confusion) jumped out, jacked the car up, and promptly
failed to loosen the nuts. No amount of stomping, standing, and brute
force would move the nuts. In the meantime, the car was heating up -
by the end I couldn't hold my camera and the steering wheel was being
held with fingertips. We asked a local for help in poor Spanish  - he
did the same stomping routine. He asked a friend, who had a extender for
the wrench. The extra metre of leverage did the trick. Science! The nuts
had probably expanded in the heat.  </p>

<p>

Since we were now without a spare tire, had hundreds of kilometers on
dirt roads to go, and it was getting late, we stopped in Cachi. Phoned
up Hertz, who said they would deliver a spare in a hour or two. The guy
who was assigned to deliver the new spare looked at his map and decided
not to bother, and also not to tell anyone. Grr.  We spent the night in
a lovely hotel - El Cortijo Hotel Boutique. The thing about staying
in hostels is that when we stay in a hotel, we wander about going "this
is so nice! Feel the sheets! And air con!". The view was also lovely.

In the morning, we found the local tire dealership (a massive operation -
something tells me the owner doesn't want the road paved), got a new tire,
and set off.  The road down to Salta is a fun drive. Though Los
Cardones national park, the road is as straight as the eye could see,
and lined with warnings about speed being enforced. I figure that once or
twice a year the cops go and ticket everyone for racing on the road. The
Park is stuffed full of cactus. A legend tells of a priest who fled
over the plateau at night - thinking the cacti were Indians chasing him.

<p>

The lack of turns in the park is made up for the road down from it.

<p>

We just about manged to navigate around Salta and get the car back
in time.  In short, if you're planning on going - go to Cafayate for
wine, take a few days to drive there and back (not two), and take a
wrench extender!</p>
