title: Into 2013, Bariloche
---

<p> We are in Bariloche in the Lakes
District of Argentina. This is supposed to be where <a
href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4170977/Did-Nazi-Adolf-Hitler-live-to-old-age-in-Bariloche-Argentina.html">Hitler
Retired</a> Hitler retired. I've guessed this from the title and cover
of a Spanish book in a shop earlier today. The guy knows how to pick a
good spot - this is the Argentinian Switzerland. It's all very alpine
and there are even  rodelbahns.  Laura points out how you just cant get
away from Hitler. I point how you've imagined a evil Dictator on a small wheeled
cart going down a hill.  Possibly we need to spend more time in Germany.  </p>

<p> That sun article reminds me of the tale of <a
href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hitler's+one+man+invasion+of+Scotland%3B+FACE-TO-FACE+WITH+EVIL%3A...-a060433070">
Hitler's visit to Knoydart.</a>

</p>

<p> The journey here has been pretty good, and we haven't had time to
update the blog much. We left Arica at the top of Chile on the 26th,
and sat on buses for 40h - interrupted by a quick curry in the nicest
Indian restaurant in Santiago.  We then missed our bus from Santiago to
Temuco, but Turbus put us on the next bus that evening. You might think
that missing a connection would be a pain - and 40 hours on a bus would
be the sort of thing the CIA would do to Pakistani teenagers, but you'd
be wrong. Chilean buses (we've mostly gone with turbus) are cheap and
comfortable, and the company doesn't gouge stranded travellers. Chile
has better public transport than the UK. If we had only deported <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet">Pinochet</a>,
  they might let us in on the secret.

</p>

<p>

The only unnerving thing about the journey was just before we went to sleep, the
conductor asked for our passports. He then pocketed them. Que freak out. Que
farcical conversation with minimal shared language asking what he was doing.
Identity theft? Crazy Chilean laws? We shall never know. Unless our passports are
used by a Israeli assassination team.

</p>

<p>
Temuco is a nice town - with real coffee and excellent chocolate (Cassis in the
mall which is very European in appearance) - but the real reason we were there
was rent a car. At this point, having rented in Norway, the US, Canada and
Argentina, we expect to at some stage to go to Turkey and have a conversation
like this:

</p>

<p>
Me: we´re thinking about driving over the border into Afghanistan, then
smuggling raw sewage cross country while being shot at by the Taliban. What do
you have?
Car rental: how about this Nissan Micra?

</p>

<p>
Anyway, First car rental lent us a really nice clean car that we knocked around,
bottomed out on a dirt road and covered in dust. Not too bad on the scale of
things.
</p>

<p>

We drove into the shadow of the volcano at Conguillio national park. The volcano
last erupted over new years in 2008 - leaving areas of the park devastated and
evacuating everyone.  We tromped up into the woods on the start of a tranverse
of the mountains. Sadly, to get to the top of the tranverse one needs tons of
gear that that we weren´t carrying. Also, the area for camping along the
traverse had the biggest, hairiest spiders we've ever seen - sleep would have
been a challange

The next day we tromped up the lava field. This is our third valle de la
luna/valley of the moon. The volcanic ash and lava looks and feels like snow.
Laura disagrees. Its not clear what she disagrees with, but she put her
disagreement in. Anyway. The only life is small lizards and insects.
</p>

<p>

Laura: it looks nothing like the photos
Pete: perhaps the photos predate the eruption

On news years day we floated around the local lake on a boat.çhe first time we
tried to hire a boat, we got it into the water, and it leaked. It leaked like a
waterfall. We went back the next day, and had a great time visiting empty
beaches, isolated waterfalls, and so on. Also, its time for this video.

We jumped on the bus down to Puerto Varas - which is very german - and the next
day headed though the .... to Argentina.
</p>

<p>

I recall hearing a story that the Brits fighting in 1982 were surprised by the
skill / abanonmnet of common sense / lack of fear / general phyospatic instincts
of the argentinian pilots. These are the same talents one needs to cross the
road here. You have to walk out and hope someone stops.

Since I´ve mentioned the war, Lonely planet´s history of Argentina takes a
certain amount of glee over the abilies of the army. It turns out that
expireance in siezing power, machine gunning thousands of dissentents, and
burying them in ditches does not translate to being good at fighting someone
else with guns. While I´m rambling - that bit of flatiey towers nails the
british attidute to the war. Props to John Cleese et al (Who wrote  the script
anyway?). It would have been so easy for them to take the mickey out of the
germans. Anyway.

Since we need dollars for a hotel in Buenos Aires and it is impossible to lay
your hands on them in Argentina. We exchanged some Chilean pesos into dollars in
Temuco. The first place quoted us an insane amount - over 30% more than the
exchange rate, we left in silence. The next place charged only 3 pesos more than
the actual rate so we paid up and went on our way.
