title: Into 2013, Bariloche
---

<p> We are in Bariloche in the Lakes
District of Argentina. This is supposed to be where <a
href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4170977/Did-Nazi-Adolf-Hitler-live-to-old-age-in-Bariloche-Argentina.html">Hitler
Retired</a> Hitler retired. I've guessed this from the title and cover
of a Spanish book in a shop earlier today. The guy knows how to pick a
good spot - this is the Argentinian Switzerland. It's all very alpine
and there are even  rodelbahns.  Laura points out how you just cant get
away from Hitler. I point how you've imagined a evil Dictator on a small wheeled
cart going down a hill.  Possibly we need to spend more time in Germany.  </p>

<p> That sun article reminds me of the tale of <a
href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hitler's+one+man+invasion+of+Scotland%3B+FACE-TO-FACE+WITH+EVIL%3A...-a060433070">
Hitler's visit to Knoydart.</a>

</p>

<p> The journey here has been pretty good, and we haven't had time to
update the blog much. We left Arica at the top of Chile on the 26th,
and sat on buses for 40h - interrupted by a quick curry in the nicest
Indian restaurant in Santiago.  We then missed our bus from Santiago to
Temuco, but Turbus put us on the next bus that evening. You might think
that missing a connection would be a pain - and 40 hours on a bus would
be the sort of thing the CIA would do to Pakistani teenagers, but you'd
be wrong. Chilean buses (we've mostly gone with turbus) are cheap and
comfortable, and the company doesn't gouge stranded travellers. Chile
has better public transport than the UK. If we had only deported <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet">Pinochet</a>,
  they might let us in on the secret.

</p>

<p>

The only unnerving thing about the journey was just before we went to sleep, the
conductor asked for our passports. He then pocketed them. Que freak out. Que
farcical conversation with minimal shared language asking what he was doing.
Identity theft? Crazy Chilean laws? We shall never know. Unless our passports are
used by a Israeli assassination team.

</p>

<p>
Temuco is a nice town - with real coffee and excellent chocolate (Cassis in the
mall which is very European in appearance) - but the real reason we were there
was rent a car. At this point, having rented in Norway, the US, Canada and
Argentina, we expect to at some stage to go to Turkey and have a conversation
like this:

</p>

<div class="quote">
Me: we're thinking about driving over the border into Afghanistan, then
smuggling raw sewage cross country while being shot at by the Taliban. What do
you have?
Car rental: how about this Nissan Micra?
</div>

<p>
Anyway, First car rental lent us a really nice clean car that we knocked around,
bottomed out on a dirt road and covered in dust. Not too bad on the scale of
things. Also, it was a relief to see water, grass and trees after all that time
in the desert.
</p>

<p>

We drove into the shadow of the volcano at Conguillio national park. The
volcano last erupted over new years in 2008 - leaving areas of the park
devastated and evacuating everyone. The roads are lined with warning
signs, volcano traffic lights, and the odd helipad. Once there, we tramped
up into the woods on the start of a traverse of the mountains. Sadly,
to get to the top of the traverse one needs tons of gear that that we
were not carrying. Also, the area for camping along the traverse had
the biggest, hairiest spiders we've ever seen - sleep would have been
a challenge.

The next day we tromped up the lava field. This is our third valle de la
luna/valley of the moon. The volcanic ash and lava looks and feels like snow.
Laura disagrees. Its not clear what she disagrees with, but she put her
disagreement in. Anyway. The only life is small lizards and insects.

Laura: it looks nothing like the photos
Pete: perhaps the photos predate the eruption

On news years day we floated around the local lake on a boat.çhe first time we
tried to hire a boat, we got it into the water, and it leaked. It leaked like a
waterfall. We went back the next day, and had a great time visiting empty
beaches, isolated waterfalls, and so on. Also, its time for this video. (Thanks
Jen!)

  After our stay in ConguillíNational Park we headed out for some cheaper
  camping in Melipeuco and found a gem of a place . Turismo Relmucura -  camping
  and a dinner with two glasses of wine for about 20 sterling. Cake, chocolate
  and costs (including fuel . the fuel filling man laughed at Laura´s bunch of
  notes) have all improved on the journey south.
  </p>
<p>

We jumped on the bus down to Puerto Varas - which is very german - and the next
day headed though the Crue de lagos to Argentina. This is the old road,
featuring 4 buses and three boats. We were a bit nevours about it, since it
looks more like a old person thing to do. We got on the bus and it was full of
older, somewhat richer, people. They were also people who were staying in a
place with a good shower. Things got off to a rough start as we were one of the
last people to get on board, and folks weren't willing to share their second
seat. Its hard to tell if this was a possible smell or just being grabby
http://theoatmeal.com/comics/airplane_heard- we jumped off at .... falls, and
everyone got in a neat queue for tickets (apart from the smelly heros ofthis
blog, who had a empadana. (side note, this was the first breakfast that wasn't
bread and cheese or musilli and water for a while)

</p>

<p>
The falls were kinda british - there were tons of people, there were safety
fences, someone came over and complained about Laura standing on a rock. Laura
then insisted on rocking a bench.

You gotta fight the man. The first boat had great views, though it was a bit
full of people. annoying people. I've noticed that people like carrying big
cameras on these sorts of trips. I like to imagine that there's a pecking order
going on, and the guy with the most camera gear is the alpha male of the pack.
His genes and opinions on gear are spread widely, from time to time, a
challanger rises. One this boat the fight was between a guy those camera lense
was longer that my arm, and another guy who hadf two massive SLRs.

<p>
We got to a tiny village at the far end of the lake, and everyone mercilly
wandered off. Wandering progress was helped by the desent of horseflies the size
of bumblebees. these can bite. If you want to expirence a bit of south america
without leaving your sofa, squeeze the flesh on your arm with pliars until your
draw blood. thats what it feels like. Laura claims they can bite though
clothing.

</p>

<p>
We did got ziplining though the trees, and watched a few birds. Zip lining is
great fun. We should do more of that. The lake was massive, and the locals own
boats rather than cars. The Boata handy public address system told us that the
boat does a special sailing to take the local kids to boarding scvhool on monday
and friday. Finding ourselves on that sailing might be worse than a pile of
americans. </p>
<p>
Anyway, the After more boat and bus trips, we made it to Argentina. Highlights
including Mount troubtor, which is covered in galacirs, and people feeding the
gulls off the back of the boat.

I recall hearing a story that the Brits fighting in 1982 were surprised by the
skill / abanonmnet of common sense / lack of fear / general phyospatic instincts
of the argentinian pilots. These are the same talents one needs to cross the
road here. You have to walk out and hope someone stops.
</p>

<p>

Since I´ve mentioned the war, Lonely planet´s history of Argentina takes a
certain amount of glee over the abilies of the army. It turns out that
expireance in siezing power, machine gunning thousands of dissentents, and
burying them in ditches does not translate to being good at fighting someone
else with guns. While I´m rambling - that bit of flatiey towers nails the
british attidute to the war. Props to John Cleese et al (Who wrote  the script
anyway?). It would have been so easy for them to take the mickey out of the
germans. Anyway.

</p>


<p>

Since we need dollars for a hotel in Buenos Aires and it is impossible to lay
your hands on them in Argentina. We exchanged some Chilean pesos into dollars in
Temuco. The first place quoted us about twice the normal rate. we just walked
out. the second place was about what we expected. The need for dollars is
because no one trusts the Argentinan Peso - or the Argentinan banks. We pay in
cash for anything smaller than a flight. Chile, of course, is also mad. They
have changed all the phone numbers, and no one can make a phone call.
</p>

<p>Well, we are almost caught up on this thing, and its getting late, so thats
about it. We have ticked over the half way point, and the end is in sight.</p>
