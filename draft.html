title: Road trip to Cachi
---

<p> We didn't do every much on Monday - we had hopes of going to the <a
  href="http://www.maam.gob.ar/">muesum</a>, but it
was closed. The Muesum would defy all attemts to visit it. We did do a
pile of planning and sorting stuff out, as well as tromping up the local
hill. On tuesday, we jumped in a hire car and took off on a road trip.
</p> <p>

We drove the southern toursit loop from Salta  - down to cafalate, up a smaller
road to cachi, then though los .... national park back to Salta. The lady in the
tuorist infomation office assured us we could do this in two days, sadly, this was
not the case.
</p>

<p>
the road down to Cafa is kinda boring until we got into the desert in .... Once
again, weird and wonderful rock foramtions drawn b y the wind and water. It was
a lovely fast drive, though the Salta traffic is insane.

Cafa is a lovely place. its the second town in argentina for wine, and if you
are looking for a place to drink wine, go there rather than mendroza. The local
wine even comes in Ice cream form!. We wandered around for a while, drunk some
of the local wine (torrentes - its a lovely white that people say is hard to get
outside argentina. ate embedapdasa while drinking wine from a jug, and peeked at
the local museum - tons of pottery recovered from local arglogical digs. we were
a bit pushed for time, so we couldn't stay a day, much as we wanted to.

the drive to Cachi was mostly on dirt roads. we set out zooming along on tarmac,
though wine yards, looking at wonderful mountings with the sun blazing down. we
overtook a local in his junker (one of the things that got me when i moved to
Ireland is that one sees more cars with dented paneling etc that ...). we
promptly hitthe dirt road, and crawled along at 30 k. the local promptly
overtook us, going much the same speed as he was doing on tarmac. huh.
</p>
<p>

The scenery on the drive is fantasic. look at the pictures!

We saw parrots, woodpeckers, a small kestrel and a few Caracaras.

we got a flat about 20k from cachi. we had been shaken about so much we didn't
hear it go, but a passerby tooted to let us know. we jumped out, jacked the car
up, and promptly failed to loosen the nuts. No amount of stomping, standing, and
brute force would move the nuts. We asked a local for help - he did the same
stomping routine. He asked a friend, who had a extender for the wrench. the
extra metre of leverage did the trick. science! The nuts had probably expanded
in the heat.
</p>
<p>

Since we were now without a spare tire, had 100s of k on dirt roads to go, and
it was getting late, we stopped in Cachi. Phoned up Hertz, who said they would
deliver a spare in a hour or two. The guy who was assigned to .... we spent the
night in a lovely hotel (get name) ...

In the morning, we found the local ire dealership (a massive operation
-something tells me the owner doesn't want the road paved) and got a new tire.
we looked around cachi (a nice enough spot, but not really worth hanging around=
and were about to get on the road when we sideswiped another car. There followed
a long attempt to sort things out, ....

The road down to salt is a fun drive. The runs though ... national park. The
road is a stright as the eye could see, and lined with warning about speed being
enforced. I figure that once or twice a year the cops go and ticket everyone for
racing on the road. the Park is stuffed full of cactus

The lack of turns in the park is made up for the the road down from it.
