title: Birding in the Cloud Forest
---

<p> On Friday, we rolled out of bed and attempted to get to El Ray
National park.  Sadly, the rain was not on our side. The road to El
Ray is a 47km dirt track with many river crossings, and our guide -
who was in a real 4x4 - didn't fancy doing it in the driving rain.
Instead we headed for his local birding spots, and on the way back
towards Salta he demonstrated the realness of his 4x4 (and the fact it
wasn't a chelsea tractor) by pulling another car out of a ditch on a
flooded road. The rescue was very Argentina - everyone stopped, and
half the local males got out, started running around in rain and the
deep mud helping, finding rope, tying it to the car and to our 4x4,
and in the end pulling the car and passengers to safety. The other
half of the population lent on their horns - we've even seen drivers
toot at the cops here (The garda would find a reason to arrest you
if you did that). Final twist to the rescue was our guide producing a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLS3RGesIFQ">Crocodile dundee
knife</a> to cut the rope off the front of his car. (Final final twist -
Laura found a online review of a tour near Salta that described a mostly
silent guide leading his party deeper and deeper into the forest, slashing
at vegetation as he went. I'm pretty certain I've seen that movie).  </p>

<p>Anyway, he took us birding, both by the lake and into the cloud forest. He was
fantastic and we saw a lot. Photos I'm happy with:</p>.

which is a great place and has fresh milk - the first we've had since
leaving Ireland. If you're wondering - we went with Mario from <a

    well worth it!</p>
