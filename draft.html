After writing about penguins, we wandered down to the naval museum in Punta
Arenas. We found ourselves watching a film about Shackleton's first trip to the pole.
Then we got on a boat.
</p>

<p>
It was the roll on, roll off ferry to Puerto Williams. The ferry is pretty small /
about 10 cars aboard. It didn't seem ideal to spend a night on, or for traversing
tiny channels at the end of the world. However, we didn't sink.

The boat ride was pretty good. The food was dire, and it rained, was windy, bleak and
cold, but otherwise fantastic. We saw dolphins, wandering albatrosses, tons of other birds,
remote mountains, glaciers, shockingly bad movies, Chile win at football, and
lots of waves. The boat runs through many tiny islands into the Beagle Channel,
and we had great views of the Cordillera Darwin and the glaciers coming down.
Chileans are pretty fond of Darwin, the boat had maps of their route, and a
picture of him as an old, somewhat stern, man.

Puerto Williams is the end of the world. Isla Navarino is a wooded, boggy, island.
 There seems to be little industry or agriculture. People visit either to do
 the Dientes circuit (a trekking route though the mountains of the island), or to
 sail around Cape Horn. The yacht folks have a excellent bar, a converted German
 cargo boat. The museum is well worth a visit and is free. It explains the lives
 of the Yaghan people. Only one Yaghan survives today, in a village just outside Puerto
 WIlliams. Their language included words for such activities as   to walk
 eastwards along a shore looking for mussels as you goÂ´ . Their children were
 not allowed to look at ibises, they had a great respect for the sea, mostly
 wore no clothing and were able to keep fires inside canoes which were a central
 part of their lives.

Oh yeah, Chile is determined to hang onto this lump of rock. There are naval ships
in the harbour, tons of old guns pointing out to sea, etc.

We took the boat to Ushuaia, in Argentina. This is a quick ride over the strait. This
is a real city, with hustle, and also bustle. And read roads. And more than one
place to eat. The town is obsessed with two things - that its el fin de mundo,
or the end of the world, and the Falkland islands. Visited another museum.
