title: San Pedro de Atacama
---

<p> Quick update, mostly to let my Mum know we haven't been kidnapped. We
are in San Pedro de Atacama in Chile. The Atacama is the driest desert on
Earth. We've been out for a walk, and its not as dry as I expected -
there are streams and life along the watercourses. Of course, where
there is no water, there is just dust.

</p>

<p> The journey was spectacular - massive salt flats, colourful rocks,
and more wildlife, including flamingos. We're popping back to take a
closer look at the flamingos tomorrow. Laura is hoping to see the rare
James' flamingo, avocets and any other waders that might be hanging around above
4000 meters. The pass at the top of the Andes is 4170
meters - high enough to cause headaches, weird tingling in the fingers,
and a bit of nausea. </p>

<p> We're been out stargazing, and the town is lovely. Not much more to
report. <a
