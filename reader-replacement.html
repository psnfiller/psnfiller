<p>I've spent some time over the St Patrick's dat weekend and this weekend
working on my google reader replacement. Its pretty much there. The code is at
<a href="https://github.com/psnfiller/reader-replacement">github</a> and there
is a okay readme there too. You can visit <a
  href="https://nuttall.im/reader/">reader</a> to try it out.</p>
