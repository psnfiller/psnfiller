title: The future will be much like the past.
---

<p>Charlie Stross - who I'm a big fan of,
sci-fi wise - has a blog post about <a
href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/02/political-failure-modes-and-th.html">
  the beige dictatorship</a>. The idea is that representative democracy
  is failing.
Failure modes: </p>

<blockquote>
  But we've somehow slid into a developed-world global-scale quasi-police
  state, with drone strikes and extraordinary rendition and unquestioned
  but insane austerity policies being rammed down our throats, government
  services being outsourced, peaceful protesters being pepper-sprayed,
  tased, or even killed, police spying on political dissidents becoming
  normal, and so on.
</blockquote>

<p>While I do enjoy any discussion of how politics plays out in the real
world, and I am concerned about everything Charlie lists, I'm unconvinced
by his premise that these are new things, a regression on the past. He
does talk about the <i>developed-world</i> (why does html not support
air quotes? Darn nerds), which I'm going to claim includes the USA, the
UK, and Ireland. He uses the first two as examples, and Ireland, well,
I live there, and its developed, right? Right?  </p>

<p><b>drone strikes and extraordinary rendition</b>. The good news
is that Ireland has not yet started bombing anyone. The bad news is
that Ireland has not started bombing Tallaght. Actually, The war on
Terror is pretty much down to one country now - the USA. Now, it is
being helped by all sorts of counties around the world, but If Obama
was to call it quits tomorrow, no one would continue the fight. Drone
strikes are new because the technology is new. Extraordinary rendition
is new because its a weasel term for kidnapping. If One talks about
assassination, detention and secret war, one finds a scary amount of
historical examples of democracies getting up to no good. Reagan and
Nicaragua. Nixon and Cambodia.  Britain, of course, waged many savage wars
of peace to keep and expand the empire. </p>

<p><b>police spying on political dissidents</b>. Hard to say if Ireland
is doing this or has done this. However, its not a new idea in the UK
or the USA. Thatcher probably spied on the Miners. That's pretty good
compared to the 70s, when MI5 spied on the prime minster. Over on the
other side of the pond, the FBI did its very best to subvert and destroy
the American communist party.</p>

<p><b>peaceful protesters being pepper-sprayed, tased, or even killed</b>. The
Peterloo Massacre stands as one example, but you could argue that the UK was not
a democracy at the time. Bloody Sunday stand as another. Ireland is probably
doing better here, with the only example that comes to mind the policing on
corrib gas. </p>

<p><b>austerity, government services being outsourced</b>. This is more
interesting. There are two groups of countries doing austerity: the UK,
and the Euro zone (including Ireland). The UK is doing it because we
voted in Tories, and that's what Tories do regardless of the economy -
sell off the public sector, cut spending, cut taxes, screw the little
guy. This isn't a regression - thatcher blah blah. The Euro zone is
more interesting. I would challenge him on <quote>unquestioned</quote>
policies - there have been massive protests in Spain, and somewhat
smaller ones in Ireland. (side note: I continue to be surprised that the
protests in Ireland have not turned violent.) The problem in Ireland,
I think, it that the country has lost its financial independence, and
the politicians of any party can't make the choices that would actually
help. Over on the far side of the Atlantic, Obama (who can do what he
wants) is stimulating as hard as he can. While looking other there,
note how their right wingers want similar politics to the Tories -
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html">recall
  this?</a>

</p>

<p>In short, I don't think any of the evils Charlie has listed are new, and I
don't think they are global problems. Chile, for example, couldn't care less for
the war on terror. Argentina is too busy worrying about its own currency to care
about Europe's austerity.</p>

<p>Here's what I think the problem is. During the nineties,
we had a long stretch of <a
  href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/bush-our-long-national-nightmare-of-peace-and-pros,464/">peace and prosperity</a>. Dictatorships
around the world collapsed. People in Northern Ireland stopped
blowing each other up. The Americans elected Clinton. The
British elected John Major - nice guy, didn't do a lot, then Tony
Blair. Old Tone was pretty good at the start. Europe came closer
together. Defence spending was cut. What wars there were were "good
wars". People expected that state to last.  Sadly, it didn't. <a
