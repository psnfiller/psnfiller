<p>Charlie Stross - who I'm a big fan of, sci-fi wise - has a blog post about

the beige dictatorship. The idea here is representive democray is failing.

  But we've somehow slid into a developed-world global-scale quasi-police state,
  with drone strikes and extraordinary rendition and unquestioned but insane
  austerity policies being rammed down our throats, government services being
  outsourced, peaceful protesters being pepper-sprayed, tased, or even killed,
  police spying on political dissidents becoming normal, and so on.

<p>While I do enjoy any discussion of how politics plays out in the real world,
and I am concerned about everything Charlie lists, I'm unconvinced by his
premise that these are new things, a regression on the past. He does talk about the <i>developed-world</i> (why does html not
support airquotes? darn nerds), which I'm going to claim includes the USA, the
UK, and Ireland. He uses the first two as examples, and Ireland, well, I live
ther, and its developed, right? right?
</p>

<p><b>drone strikes and extraordinary rendition</b>. The good news is that
Ireland has not yet started bombing anyone. The bad news is that Ireland has not
started bombing Tallaght. Atually, The war on Terror is pretty much down to one
country now - the uSA. Now, it is being helped by all sorts of counties around
the world, but If Obama was to call it quits tomorrow, no one would continue the
fight. Drone strikes are new because the technolagy is new. extraordinary
rendition is new because its a weasel term for kidnapping. If One talks about
assination, dentention and secert war, one finds a scary amount of historical examples of
democarices getting up to no good. Regean and nigara. Nixon and Camboia.
Britain, of course, waged many savage wars of peace to keep and expand the
empire. </p>

<p><b>police spying on political dissidents</b>. Hard to say if Ireland is doing
this or has done this. However, its not a new idea in the UK or the USA. Thacher
probably spied on the Miners. Thats pretty good compared to the 70s, when MI5
spied on the prime minster. Over on the other side of the pond, the FBI did its
very best to destroy and subvert the american communist party.</p>

<p><b>peaceful protesters being pepper-sprayed, tased, or even killed</b>. The
Peterloo Massacre stands as one example, but you could arge that the UK was not
a democary at the time. Bloody sunday stand as another. Ireland is probably
doing better here, with the only example that comes to mind the policing on
corrib gas. </p>

<p><b>austerity, government services being outsourced</b>. This is more
interesting. There are two groups of countries doing austerity: the UK, and the
eurozone (including Ireland). The Uk is doing it becuse we voted in toires, and
thats what tories do reguardless of the ecomeny - sell off the public sector,
cut spending, cut taxes, screw the little guy. This isn't a regression -
thatcher blah blah. The eurozone is more interesting. I would challange him on
<quote>unquestioned</quote> policies - there have been massive protests in
spain, and somewhat smaller ones in Ireland. (side note: I continue to be
susprised that the protests in Ireland have not turned vilolent.) The problem in
Ireland, I think, it that the country has lost its indepenence, and the
polotician can't make the choices that would actually help. Over on the far side
of the atlantic, Obama (who can do what he wants) is stimulating as hard as he
can. While looking other there, note how their right wingers want similar
polotics to the tories -

<p>Here's what I think the problem is. during the ninites, we had a long strech
of peace and proserpity. Dictatorships around the world collasped. People in
Northern Ireland stops blowing each other up. The americans elected clinton. The
british elected John major - nie guy, didn't do a lot, then Tony Blair. Old Tone
was pretty good at the start. Europe came closer together. Defense spending was
cut. What wars there were were "good wars". People expected that state to last.
Sadly, it didn't.
