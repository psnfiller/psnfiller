<p>When I was a kid, my dad took me to see <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torness_Nuclear_Power_Station">Torness
  Power Nuclear Power station</a>. Pre 9/11,British Nuclear used to do
  a tour.
Its a iconic building south of Edinburgh - clearly visible from
the road and the railway. A bright white box surrounded by green
fields and the blue of the north sea behind. They must have paid
someone to make it look clean. In comparison, I've also been up to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longannet_power_station">Longannet</a>.
they have a few football fields of coal dumped in front. The dust rising
as the bulldozers stir would floor a stadium of ashmatics.  </p>

<p>The tour did a pretty good job at convincing young me that the operators knew
what they were doing. thewere hosesnt on the subject of nuclear waste - they had
the classice video of the waste vessewl being hit by a train. They also had a
map of the rail network waste moved down - including a route past our hourse.
They had phptoshopped views of what the site would look like in the decades
after closure. They had a actual year for closure (I think its passed). All in
all, its a long way from operation desert glow.

<p> Over here in Patagonia, the Chilean goverment was going though a long saga to
build hydroelectric power plants in patagonia. Of course, the electricy needs of
patagonian residents could be met by a fat kid on a treadmill.
The plan is to run power lines to the North of Chile and to Sanitago. Then to
have brown-outs whenever the thousands of miles of cable broke. Of course, the
power plants will need to drown a few thousand miles of wilderness behind dams.
Amoung the wildlife that will be wiped out is the national symbol of chile. This
amuses me greatly.

I know about this because I see the PR campanian in favour of it. The constrast
with torness is striking. Rather than be honest about the scale and nature of
the project, they have a cartoon wheel turning in a river. Watching this, I
figure that all Chileans are idiots. Or someone thinks they are idiots. Or
somone got paid before the results of the PR campain are in. Chileans, who can
smell nonsense with the same skill as folks all over the world, are opposed.
Sadly, Chile will probaly build its dams one day. And torness stopped doing
tours. And no one will ever build another noclear power plant. They paved
paradise and put up a parking lot.
