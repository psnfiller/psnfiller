<p>I started supporting spdy this morning. It as pretty simple. I downloaded the
most recent version of openssl (to pick up NPN) and the ngnix source and a
patch. Applied patch, built a static ngnix binary, and off we went. Only
problem was fiddling with the init script refer to the new binary and the config
in /etc. I also cleaned up a few bits of the ngnix config. <a

<p>Oh, can you spot why this extract from debian's /etc/init.d/ngnix might not be
ideal?</p>
