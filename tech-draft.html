title: Splitters - or nerdy stuff going elsewhere
---

<p>I've started putting the nerdy content in <a
  href="https://nuttall.im/tech.html">tech</a>. There's a <a
  href="/https://nuttall.im/tech.xml">atom feed</a> too. There's also a <a href="everything.html">everything</a> page.</p>

<p>Sorry about breaking the atom feed and spraying updates everywhere.</p>
