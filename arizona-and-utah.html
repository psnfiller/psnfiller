<p>I was in California for work, and we flew from there to Las Vegas. Then we drove to Salt Lake City, visiting three national parks on the way.

<p><b>Las Vegas</b> We got out of Las Vegas as fast as we could, being somewhat
crippled by only being about to make right turns. We got a look at the place
from the air and boggled at the slot machines in the arrivals hall, and figured
that was enough sin for us. </p>

<p><b>Hoover Dam</b>. We stopped by the Dam and peered over the
edge. Its a very impressive concrete plug with miles of weirdly suspended
power Lines.  Naming a depression-era Keynesian employment scheme after
Hoover is a bit like naming Tony Blair as middle east peace envoy. Now,
of course, the dam provides the power for Las Vegas's million air-con
units and miles of neon lights. The dam has flags and Engels and angels
and a monument to the builders. And Nevada has two senators arguing
against the US government spending money to create jobs. No where is
history sense of humour more evident than the USA. Anyway, we saw a
Turkey vulture over the dam.  </p>
