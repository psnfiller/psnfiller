<p>Over on hacker news there was a guy showing off his website that prints
inspirational quotes at you. I'm sure that by now he's worth more than Bill
Gates. I'm not really a fan of inspirational quotes. I wondered if it would be
possible to generate such quotes at random.

</p>

<p>Enter python. Enter a Markov chain. Enter a collection of quotes taken from
the internet. Look on the  following and despair. </p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity is art.</li>
<li>Love it doesn't matter how far it work make it doesn't matter how far it as I like the journey is a man while he who i feel myself moving forwar</li>
<li>ds.</li>
<li>You just about as a runner it's only way to failure without losing your enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Any road will fall for life is the artist, and the courage to all success.</li>
<li>Make it doesn't matter if you there is that I can hold the day or if you can do excellence, therefore, is calm.</li>
<li>Do and thoughts as if you don't stand like a succession of opportunities.</li>
<li>Govern thy life is a good designer by going beyond them into the artist, and go slowly.</li>
<li>One can or how fast or nothing.</li>

<li>Make up their minds to be understood.</li>
<li>In motion just a habit.</li>
<li>No incentive to prepare for life is the history of the current; in matters of their dreams of life is the sum of the artist, and more and less, I grow to be.</li>
<li>We repeatedly do excellence, therefore, is the sea is a little bit, one can or another.</li>
<li>Success.</li>
<li>Any one way of finding the possible is to those who believe in your enthusiasm.</li>
<li>If I'm completely satisfied with what I grow to start.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Simplicity is art.</li> founds real to me.</p>
