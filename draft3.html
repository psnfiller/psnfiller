title: White water rafting
---

<p> Hello folks, Laura here. As promised, a few details about this
excellent day out over a week ago. We went with Extremo Sur and highly
recommend them. It was so much fun.We went up a valley to a farm
where we got changed into wetsuits and the rest of the gear. Then it
was down the R&iacute;o Manso Inferior (river) for a safety talk and
then we were off. It was utterly superb and I didn't want it to end.
The river is stunning - clear water, high cliffs, wonderful forest and
views of mountain ridges. And the excellent rapids. I have always been
hopeless at water sports and could just about swim across a river but we
had an excellent guide and I loved it. We went in for an (intentional)
swim twice. The swimming position is on your back with your backside
lowered and the water carries you along. All good things come to an end
and when we came out of the river we headed up to the border with Chile
and then past a customs office and back to the farm for an <i>asado</i>
which was excellent. We had some good chat with an Australian girl and
two Argentinians who wanted to know lots about Ireland and the UK and
what we thought of Argentina.  </p>
