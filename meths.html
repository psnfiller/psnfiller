title: The fuel saga
---

<p>We have been having a long yak shave over camping fuel. We didn't
bring any as airlines frown on carrying it. Lonely planet tells horror
stories of airlines throwing out stoves altogether. We have a  <a
  href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trangia">Trangia</a>
. It burns <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methylated_spirit">meths</a>.
This is near pure alcohol. It would look like water and be drinkable
normally, so most countries, including the UK, insist it have a added
smell and colour, and be otherwise undrinkable. Of course, very country
picks its own colour.  </p>

<p>
We knew all this because at some stage, dad had bought some in Norway (where its
called Rod spirit). The bottle came back half full, and when I went on DoE, I
took the rod spirit along to finish off. The teacher running the trip sniffed
the bottle, peered at the red liquid, and declared it not to be meths. I pointed
out it was Norwegian, hence the funny characters, and it burnt like meths. I came
home from the trip with half a bottle of British meths and half a bottle of rod
spirit. My dad was not pleased. However, it could have gone worse - if I had
pointed out to the teacher that rod spirit was alcohol.
</p>

<p>
At the time, I figured this was  some sort of metaphor for the DoE scheme - how
the scheme had been corrupted into some sort of rule following exercise, and so
on and so forth. These days, I figure the old Duke would be proud of the
teachers knee jerk rejection of anything foreign.

Back to 2013 (a quick hi there to the woman on Amtrak who told me that the world
would end in 2012. She was completely straight faced). Finding meths in Chile
wasn't so bad - we asked in a outdoor store (which was useless, rant about that
coming) and they directed us to the local hardware store. The guy there
tolerated our Spanish (he must of been the one guy in San Pedro who didn't work
in the tourism industry) and sold us a bottle. We filled up our fuel bottle, and
left the remainder with the hostel owner in Arica. He was happy to get some
"People are always asking me where to get this!".
</p>

<p>
That was the start of the odyssey. When we showed up in barilochie, we figured
buying more fuel (the Chilean stuff burnt hot but quickly, and we needed more)
would be easy. We are in a hiking capital of the world, right? How hard can it
be?
</p>

Turns out that the walking stores around here are mostly useless unless you
want to buy clothes. No idea why. However, one shop assistent pointed us to the
good store, where among fishing poles, guns, and actually useful gear, we
managed to buy some stuff. They didn't have fuel, and were possibly the first
place to mention MSR (so many places though we wanted MSR that I considered
getting a tshirt. "No. I don't want MSR, thanks for asking"). The local
hardware store sold us unviersal solvente - no idea what it is yet. The internet
turned up a list of names used Argentina. the local pharmacy recognized one of them,
and pointed us to a small supermarket selling nothing but cleaning products.
There, in among the hairspray and the toilet roll, we found our fuel. The guy
there asked if it was for fondue. Told you this place was like Switzerland.
