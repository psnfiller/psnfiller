title: I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous
---

<p> We have seen Glaciers before. I think the first time for me was in
Canada. We visited a closed viewpoint in Banff national park. We waded
though waist deep snow to peer down on a very blue lake and the grey ice
below. Snow was all around, and heavy clouds hung over us. The white of
the snow and the grey of the rock is all I recall seeing of the glacier
and the ice field beyond. It was cold.  We had a way to drive before
night and snow fall. The first time Laura tried to turn the car, it
slid off the snow covered road and into a gentle snowbank.  We turned
away from the glacier. Perhaps its more spectacular in summertime, when,
you know, its actually open for viewing.  </p>

<p> School had a photo of a glacier in France. It looks muddy and was a
odd gray-brown colour. Each year a field trip visited it. School had a
collection of photos taken from  the same spot, year after year. Each
year it had retreated many meters.  These days I assume
the glacier has retreated out of shot, much like me with a duvet and a
hangover. One day it will be gone altogther. Needless, to say, this makes me a
bit sad.

Peirto Moreno is nothing like these. A massive white wall of ice advancing over the
valley, it seems otherworldly. It is impossible to fit it all in. Behind the
leading wall, the glacier and the ice field behind it stretch to the horizon. Up
close, one watches spires of ice fall silently until they hit the water. The
boom of impact echoes from the mountains. Enormous cracking noises, like a
giant standing on a frozen sea, come from deep within the glacier as it crawls
forward. Icebergs bob in the milky water. Semi circles of ice come out from the
edge - marking places where the glacier has calved off more chunks.
Pering into the cracks, one sees a deep blue white colour, suggesting a
impossible maze of chasms and fractures.

The Glacier has crawled down out of the mountain. It has hit twoproblems - a
mountain, and a large river. The Glacier crawls out into the river. After many
months, it reaches the other side and blocks the river. Neither the ice nor the
warer can orde the mountain fast enough. the water level rises until the presure
undercuts the glaicer, leading the river to flow under a arch in the ice.  After
yet more time, t arch, worn by the water and presured by the weight of the ice,
crack and expodes, leaving the river to run free once more.

the only way of fully understanding the size of the sight is to take to the air.
the mountain, bigger than anything in Ireland, in barely noticeabl e  in the
picutures. the river, large enough to have a detachment of the argentine navy )
no, I dont know why or what they were doing), strinks on the postcard. the

<p>
glacier, miles of cracks and wrinkles covering its surface, looks like a
unstoppable force, send down from the andes to march, sherman like, over the
patagonia steppe.


<p> Anyway. we have no photos because this whole town
gets it internet by encoding bits into icebergs floating down<a

. The acks come back in the tourist copies of in patagonia. If
you think the mylodon is a metaphor for Chatwin's sanity, you are carrying a
