<p> We've made it to Santiago! Long trip, lots of packing. Looking
forward to decompressing a bit.

When I was a kid I played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spycat">Spycat</a> which
depicts a guy trying to get his stuff together and leave London. Thats
roughly what the last few days have been like, without the cctv and
the eighties parody. After two days of solid packing and little sleep,
we made it to the airport with all our stuff - thanks to Mark our pastor
for giving us a lift :-)
</p>

<p> We flew into Madrid airport. The plane was only about a third full
- probably should have been a warning sign - and the pilot didn't think
much of this new-fangled concept of keeping his plane going in a straight
line on takeoff. The airport was massive and completely empty. It was like
wandering around in a ghost town. The size and quiet brought to mind a
concrete cathedral. It reminded me of the new terminal at Dublin before
it got airlines, or the cinema in eastpoint. Why do countries always
decide to upgrade their capital airport just before the money runs out?

</p><p> We had a many hour wait for the next flight, so we popped
into Madrid on the metro. The metro was completely packed. Theory one:
Madrid is some sort of prison camp for obnoxious people from all over
Europe. They get carted off, taught spanish, and told to live there until
they get manners. The only reason we haven't heard about this is the
eurozone - if Britain would just join or Ireland would just stop losing
money, we too could ship our folks off to Madrid. I also suspect the
Spanish are dreading the arrival of Cameron. Theory two was that it was
rush hour, which has the advantage of being simple and is probably true.

</p><p>
As I said, we've been working on speaking Spanish. Fears became flesh when
we heard the first announcement in Spanish on the plane. We're probably
doomed. Getting dinner in Madrid did nothing to reassure us. Leaving
the restaurant, we promptly found ourselves close to a demonstration,
along with many riot police. And when we got back to the airport, it was
announced that Spain was having a general strike. This possibly explains
the quiet airport.
</p>
<p>

I read through "In Patagonia" and "The old Patagonian express" on the
flight; good reads. We'll probably get rid of the books soonish to save on
weight. Paul Theroux makes fun of travel books that talk about arriving in
places by plane "the toy town appearance of a city in the Andes" but for
us it wasn't like that. We got on the plane, rejected the food and fell
asleep. At some point - possibly after coffee - we flipped up the window
blinds and the Andes were right there. Quite a sight. (Note from Laura:
this is a classic case of Pete's reserve - it was an outstanding view).
</p>

 <p> We've survived Chilean customs (quick panic about the pepper
pot we were carrying), pushed past the taxi drivers and got into town
by bus. First impressions are its somewhat like California. Its hot and
dusty, roads are big. They seem to be building concrete tower blocks
here - possibly due to the earthquake. Seems crazy to me to build high
and heavy on top of a fault line, but what do I know. Laura thinks the
place is crumbly. No idea what she means. I fear her apple crumble.
The hostel is nice, and has good internet. Woo.
