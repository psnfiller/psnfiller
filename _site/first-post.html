Turns out you do a test at 32 days into the cycle. Now the box tells you to do
it in the morning, when your pee is strongest. Tuns out we were too excited to
sleep. Did the test at 1am. Pregnancy Santa comes early. Test packet actually had
two tests inside, like a stats problem. Called the doctor, popped in, and he
confirmed the result. Wee!

He also asked the question "was it planned?". Well, yes and no, planned but not
with precision and 14 weeks of folic acid behind us . When people talked
about planing I have a vision of a time line, and a deck of slides. REQUIREMENTS:
one child. PLAN: this part censored. ESTIMATED TIME OF DELIVERY: and so on and so
forth. Or I think of books with titles like "How to get pregnant".  Found this
book once, and was shocked, just shocked, by the child friendly nature of it.
Instead we just took our seat belts off, and drained the car of brake fluid.

Oh yeah, because we thought it would take a while - Laura keeps hearing horror
stories about how long it takes - we didn't bother to give up booze, soft
cheese, and so on, that would be tough for 2 or more years. Mentioned this to Dr Ryan. "Water under the bridge. That ship
has sailed". The ship has sailed under the bridge and knocked a mast off. That
mast is your son's arm. Anyway.

I'm sure someone out there is judging us. Now, I could quote the bible at you,
but that ended a bit poorly for the guy saying judge not. Instead, I'm planning
to fart if you bring it up in conversation, and say "you smell that? Its the stink
of your self-righteousness". I feel this would be both classy and subtle.

So far the child reminds me of a black hole. He's really really small, and you
can only tell he's there by external effect. However, he effects everything.
Where shall we live? Depends on the child. Shall we jump up and down for a
hour? Probably a bad idea.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, we aren't planning on telling anyone. This secret combined
with massive effect reminds me of some information theory problem.  Are you
coming to my wedding? (quick date maths, possible 8 months) well, we
would like to, but its possible that we might be unable to travel. YOU
MUST BE PREGNANT LET ME TELL EVERYONE.

We Conceived either in El Chalten, Argentina or Punta Arenas, Chile. I hope the
former but it's awesome either way. Considered names based on Fitzroy. Read this
thing of darkness. Grim stuff. Not the thing you want to think of when looking
at the daughter.
