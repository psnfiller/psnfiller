  </span> &raquo; <a href="/ssl.html">Nerd updates</a></h2>
<div id="home">

<p> <b>Nerdy content</b> I made a few changes to the blog. I have moved
  the URL to <a href="www.nuttall.im">www.nuttall.im</a>, rather than
  http://nuttall.im/chile/. There
was  not anything interesting on / anyway. I should have got mod_rewrite
  to do the correct rewriting, but if a url is broken for you - or
something is broken for you - let me know at psn _at_ nuttall.im.  </p>

<p>I've moved to SSL and <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">STS</a>.
    The long term goal for ssl is either to set up <a
    href="http://antony.lesuisse.org/software/ajaxterm/">ajaxterm</a>
  or similar, or to play around with <a
  href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy">spdy.</a> I would like ajaxterm
as a backup for putty in internet cafes, and I want to play around with
spdy anyway. STS protects against <a
    href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/">sslstrip</a>,
        and also does a better job
at flushing out mixed content warnings.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/07/19/hope9talk.html">Adam
Langley's blog</a> is pretty good at explaining what to do. I got the
certs off <a href="http://www.startssl.com/">startssl</a> - who were
  puzzled by an Argentinian IP and Dublin
address and wanted to ask more questions. They were convinced
by a Google maps photo of the roof of my block of flats. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Trillions">Ob
Simpson's reference.</a> I also screwed up serving the certs with Apache
- and didn't send the full chain. This broke Firefox, but not chrome. Problem
    found by my Dad and reproduced with <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=nuttall.im">ssllabs test thingo.</a></p>

<p>I have found one problem with ssl - <a
href="http://disqus.com/">disqus</a>
broke. It fetched a resource over http. The Google suggested turning
off their 2012 update. It seems to work after that.</p>

<p>I added the www subdomain so I could scope cookies to www.nuttall.im, not
  nuttall.im. I'm not doing much with cookies, so I might change that back.</p>
