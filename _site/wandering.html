<div id="home">

<p>
We have been in Santiago for about two days now. In real terms, this is the end
of our stay. We had assumed we would conk out due to jetlag, but that has not
really happened. I think this is due to the time difference being pretty small
- only three hours - and due to us being tired enough to sleep on the flight.
We are staying at a lovely hostel in Barrio Brasil. Its a old building, full
of wood panelling. We do not know what it was before it was a hostel - the guy on
the desk thinks it was a government building.

</p>

<p>

The Hostel is in a area full of car parts shops. Every single business seems
to be a car parts shop. No idea why. No one we have asked knows why. In the
middle of the neighbourhood is a monkey puzzle tree. All the buildings are old
and dusty and coming apart.
</p>
<p>

On the first day, we took the metro out to Las Condes - a modern neighbourhood
that reminded me of Vancouver. Its has the same high rise glass buildings and
looming mountains. Unlike Canada the mountains are brown - the same colour as
the hills over the bay from San Francisco, but much closer and much bigger.
</p>
<p>

One of the things I like here is that eating and drinking often takes place
outside, on the street. The climate supports that. Every now and again, some
crazy guy suggests that Edinburgh could have the same cafe culture. Then it
starts raining and people make fun of him.
</p>
<p>


On the first night we ate in a great restaurant and had our first pisco sours, a
favourite drink here. They are made from distilled grapes and are very
refreshing. Calf testicles were on the menu but we avoided them and had raw wild
boar instead.
</p>
<p>

The second day we wandered out of the neighbourhood around the hostel and
into la centro. We toured the old buildings of Santiago. The national
museum is a very old building just off the central square, is pretty
much incomprehensible without a good grasp of spanish. It also cuts
right on a coup in 1973, which was a bit creepy. We then wandered over
to the presidential palace and the statue of Allende.  The main thing
thats different about here is that all the old buildings, offices of
government etc are overshadowed by lots of massive grey tower blocks.

</p>
<p>

We wandered up Cerro Santa Lucia - a hill near the center of town. Looked out
over miles of tower blocks and smog. We wandered through the rush hour traffic -
which is completely insane by the way, I feel like I am taking an advanced course in
jay-walking - into Barro Bellavista. This neighbourhood reminded me of Fremont
in Seattle, though without the "set your watch back five minutes" sign.  We
shunned climbing up a hill to see the papal statue.
</p>
<p>
We ate curry for dinner. Its not that, uh, exotic, but we freaked out at the
idea that we might not eat curry for three months. Was good. So far, a good time
being had by all. Had hoped to get some photos on the web, but that has not
happened yet.
