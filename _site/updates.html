I have one day of work left. My boss points out that I'm not being
fired, and I even get to keep my badge. And my
gun<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. Sarah, our admin, can't wait to have another
free desk. She hasn't actually said "when do you go? I need the space",
but she's thinking it hard. The other work related content is

Laura: While you don't work for the daily mail, you do work for google,
which lets people find daily mail articles on cancer, so you're pretty much
internet Hitler.

Laura's been making us learn Spanish. The idea is that we'll not
be one of those annoying people who expect the whole world to speak
English. Instead we'll be saying No lo entiendo a lot. The guide book
claims that Chile is one of the places where the locals are really glad
the visitors attempt to speak the language. Sounds like a lie. Reminds
me of the Norway guidebook that claimed that speed limits were carefully
followed and ruthlessly enforced.  At the point in which the tenth BMW
doing 150&#37; of the limit blew past us, we saw the error of our
ways. Or the walking in Ireland book which directed us into not one but
two bogs. Getting to the top of one hill in the driving rain and miles
of bog, then seeing the dry trail up the other side wasn't a big enough
hint. A month or so later, still following the book, we found ourselves
sliding down a very boggy, very steep hillside. You might wonder how
one can have a non-flat bog. This is article seven of my mysteries of
Ireland questions, after such greats as pondering the celtic tiger,
the catholic church, and people still living in Limerick. Anyway,
ranting over. We will see how the Spanish works out.

I wandered along and got some Chilean and Argentine money earlier in the
evening. It came from the currency exchange place near Trinty college, which was
the only place in all of Dublin to have south american money. Said place gives
the faint air that its predecessor was target of a 4am ram raid. Or possibly a
ned with a shotgun. Its hard to tell.

</p>

<p>

Chilean money reminds me of the collapse of the Wilmar republic. Its
not that Chile is going into any sort of depression, its just that the
numbers are so big. Argentine money, on the other hand, is shaky enough
that places often just want to be paid in dollars. Sad.

We've started packing. This is not going well.
