<p>
I'm a nerd. Here's some nerdy notes.
</p>

<p>

Cameras: I'm planning to take my point and shoot. its maybe
a year old. Its grand. Now the bad news is that I can take
a lot of photos - over 100 a day. So amazon sent us 10 8g sd
cards. Betcha we still run out. Betcha that I look at the idea
of only 80g of storage and laugh. I've also bought space on
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/102479403334301156799">Picasa</a>
which was dead cheap. The hope there is that we'll be able to get the
originals back through <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">takeout</a>
later. Facebook is much more of a pain in this respect. We've also got
some blank cds, which we'll try and back stuff up onto. The fear here
is both losing or damaging a SD card, and also theft.

</p>

<p>
My Camera can upload photos direct to the internet. Making this functionallity
work has been a pain in the backside. It also seems to drain the battery. We'll
see if it works out there.
</p>

<p>

We'll probably want to get into email and facebook while
we're out there. We'll probably do it from internet
cafes with interesting collections of malware. So <a
href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-two-step-authentication/">2
factor</a> and <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150172618258920">SMS
auth</a>. SMS auth is a bit more of a pain as we don't really know phone
numbers out there - experience and common sense argues for buying a new
sim card. I've also picked up a
<a href="http://www.yubico.com/yubikey">yubikey</a> for
<a href="https://lastpass.com/">lastpass</a>. We'll probably still have
problems.
</p>

<p>

I'm taking an android phone, and to reduce the impact of it being lost or
stolen I've set up the android / google apps corp system for registering
phones <a href="https://www.google.com/apps/mydevices">the control
panel</a>. It lets you ring phones, wipe phones remotely and tells you where
they are. Its a google apps for your domain feature that actually costs
money, but its pretty cheap. And it means I never lose my phone again. I also set
up the normal security settings - encrypting the phone and so on. We'll see.

</p>

<p>
This site is hosted on a little virtual machine sitting in London. To get into
it I depend on ssh keys. I've stuck those keys on my phone and can connect with
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/connectbot/">connectbot</a>, but using a unix
text editor with a phone's keyboard may drive me insane. We'll see how much
blogging we do ;-). I have thought about putting <a
  href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a> and the
keys on a USB stick and plugging it into internet cafes - we'll see.
</p>

<p>
I also have a kindle. I like the kindle as its dead light and has a ton of books
on it. Laura points out the kindle will probably be nicked. We'll see. At least
I bought a waterproof bag for it at some earlier point.
