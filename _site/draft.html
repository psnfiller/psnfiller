We are in Bariloche in the Lakes District of Argentina. This is supposed to be
where Hitler retired. I´ve guessed this from the title and cover of a spanish
book in a shop earlier today. The guy knows how to pick a good spot - this is
the argentinian Switzerland. It´s all very alpine and there are even rodelbahns.
Laura points out how you just cant get away from Hitler. Possibly we need to
spend more time in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Tha sun article reminds me of the tale of Hitler´s visit to Knoydart.

</p>

<p>
The journey here has been pretty good, and we haven´t had time to update the
blog much. We left Arica at the top of Chile on the 26th, and sat on buses for
40h - interupted by a quick curry in the nicest indian restaurant in Santiago.
We then missed our bus from Santiago to Temuco, but Turbus put us on the next
bus that evening. You might think that missing a connection would be a pain -
and 40 hours on a bus would be the sort of thing the CIA would do to pakistani
teenagers, but youd be wrong. Chilean buses (we´ve mostly gone with turbus) are
cheap and comfortable, and the company doesnt gouge stranded travellers. Chile
has better public transport than the UK. If we had only shot pinochet, they
might let us in on the secret.

</p>

<p>

The only unnerving thing about the journey was just before we went to sleep, the
conductor ask for our passports. He then pocketed them. Que freakout. Que
farcial conversation with minal shared language asking what he was doing.
Identity theft? Crazy chilean laws? we shall never know. Ùless our passports are
used by a Israeli assasination team.

</p>

<p>
Temuco is a nice town - with real coffee and excellent chocolate (Cassis in the
mall which is very european in appearance) - but the real reason we were there
was rent a car. At this point, having rented in Norway, the US, Canada and
Argentina, we expect to at some stage to go to Turkey and have a conversation
like this:

</p>

<p>
Me: we´re thinking about driving over the border into Afghantisan, then
smuggling raw sewage cross country while being shot at by the taliban. what do
you have?
car rental: how about this nissan micra?

</p>

<p>
Anyway, First car rental lent us a really nice clean car that we knocked around,
bottomed out on a dirt road and covered in dust. Not too bad on the scale of
things.
</p>

<p>

We drove into the shadow of the volcano at Conguillio national park. The volcano
last erupted over new years in 2008 - leaving areas of the park devastated and
evacuating everyone.  We tromped up into the woods on the start of a tranverse
of the mountains. Sadly, to get to the top of the tranverse one needs tons of
gear that that we weren´t carrying. Also, the area for camping along the
traverse had the biggest, hairest spiders we´ve ever seen - sleep would have
been a challange

</p>

The next day we tromped up the lava field. This is our third valle de la
luna/valley of the moon. The volcanic ash and lava looks and feels like snow.
Laura disagrees. The only life is small lizards and insects.
</p>

<p>

Laura: it looks nothing like the photos
Pete: perhaps the photos predate the eruption

On news years day we floated around the local lake on a boat.
</p>

<p>

We jumped on the bus down to Puerto Varas - which is very german - and the next
day headed though the .... to Argentina.
</p>

<p>

I recall hearing a story that the Brits fighting in 1982 were surprised by the
skill / abanonmnet of common sense / lack of fear / general phyospatic instincts
of the argentinian pilots. These are the same talents one needs to cross the
road here. You have to walk out and hope someone stops.
</p>

<p>

Since I´ve mentioned the war, Lonely planet´s history of Argentina takes a
certain amount of glee over the abilies of the army. It turns out that
expireance in siezing power, machine gunning thousands of dissentents, and
burying them in ditches does not translate to being good at fighting someone
else with guns. While I´m rambling - that bit of flatiey towers nails the
british attidute to the war. Props to John Cleese et al (Who wrote  the script
anyway?). It would have been so easy for them to take the mickey out of the
germans. Anyway.

Since we need dollars for a hotel in Buenos Aires and it is impossible to lay
your hands on them in Argentina. We exchanged some Chilean pesos into dollars in
Temuco. The first place quoted us an insane amount - over 30% more than the
exchange rate, we left in silence. The next place charged only 3 pesos more than
the actual rate so we paid up and went on our way.
