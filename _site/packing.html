<div id="home">

<p>Today I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Exit_to_Springfield">Last exit to
  Springfield</a> twice. This must be what being unemployed is like. Soon I will
vote tory. In other news, I rang my british bank and asked them not to block my card.
They told me the blocking was done by an automatic system, it was impossible to
override said system, and it was for my protection. The back of my head went
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOjXyarN3-Y&feature=related">duh duh dun-duh duh</a>. </p>

<p>
We've been packing like crazy. Turns out that we have both way more and way less
stuff than we thought. The good news that stuff packs really well into our
storage space. The bad news is we have way too much stuff. Seems like we've been
packing for weeks and weeks.
</p>

<p>Vaguely amusing side story here - Laura has labelled the three euro boxes sold by
the storage place as a complete rip off, a scam more blatant than my folder full
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam">419 mail.</a> So we've
popped around to the local off licenses and picked up tons of old booze boxes. A
good chunk of them are for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco">Prosecco</a>.
Who are our neighours? What are they celebrating? How do we get invites? The world is full
of questions.
</p>

<p>Its not all cardboard and tape. Some recent photos from around the area:</p>

</ul>

<p> The schedule is simple - tomorrow, put everything in storage, and wednesday,
get on plane ;-).</p
