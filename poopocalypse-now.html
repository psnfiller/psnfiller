<p><b>Warning - disgusting content</b>. While I was remising about Banff
national park, I forgot a detail in the story - the toilet.  We opened
it up to see a bare concrete room with a toilet seat in the middle. The
seat was surrounded by a thin patch of snow. It might not be instantly
clear what is happening here, so I'll spell it out. Air from somewhere
north of the artic cicle is being blown down, over the ice flied and
glacier. it then picks up a few furries of flakes from the parking lot,
and blows them into the vent in the bottom of the toleit and up though
the seat. needless to say, this makes for short short toliet queues.  </p>

<p>

The toliet near Laguna Torre is worse.  From the outside, it ooks
completely, normal.  Just a portaloo in the middle of a wood, though
unlike most portloo deployments, this one had guy wires and was held
shut with a log. We pulled away the log and the door opened.  A stench
rolled out and slapped us in the face. Inside, there was nothing but a
hole in the plywood floor.

I had had a breakfast of all-bran, coffee, and brown toast, so I
went first. I placed a boot either side of the hole, and squatted.
A problem arose. I'm a bit heavier than the normal user.  the plywood was
bending. It was damp (a sign asked users to clean up if they missed).
My boot slipped a little. I freaked out. started to hyperventilate.
I saw the future. A bigger slip. a drop. Hitting a couple years worth of
the sole thing visitors are allowed to leave in the park.  My boot didn't
slip any more. I may go on amazon.com and leave a positive review. I
got out as fast as I could.

Laura named the spot campsite constapation. She then remised for half
and hour or so about the toliets in Yosemite. Up north, they let you
take soap into national parks.
