title: Nahuel Huapi Traverse
---

<p>
We are back from the Nahuel Huapi traverse. Its been a tough six days, and now
we are completely shattered and drinking lots of water. Also everything stinks.
I have this fear we'll be kicked out of the hostel due to the smell. Here are
some notes on the route, which might be of use to others.
</p>

<p> Maps and stuff: we used the lonely planet book <a
href="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/south-america/trekking-in-the-patagonian-andes-4/">Trekking
in the Patagonian Andes</a>. The times in the book are
optimistic. Speculation as to why: </p>

<ul>
  <li> The author retired from the SAS, or some other job that required running
  up hills.</li>
  <li>The author wasn't carrying a tent, food, stove, etc.</li>
  <li>The author was in the process of writing a book on patagonian treks and
  was therefore somewhat fitter than us.</li>
  <li> The author had spent the past few years working as a mountain guide.</li>
</ul>


<p>
I like the first theory, though the last two have the advantage of being true.
</p>

<p> The map was kinda crappy too. Crags aren't marked. I suppose that if
you want a map with crags they start with a black bit of paper.  The nav
was pretty easy throughout the trip, but mostly because we could see the
way owing to good weather. It would be a pain to do in poor weather.  </p>

<p>
We drank the water from the rivers. It was lovely and freezing cold. We often
had our cups on the outside of our bags, and dipped them into streams. We passed
a gang of scouts singing the Spanish version of "I want to go a wandering". That's
our life now. Drinking water from streams, singing kids, green trees, Lewis and
Clark wandering past, foxes barking.
</p>

<p>
In less good water news, the folks down in CAB suggested added a drop of bleach
to each litre of water.
</p>

<p>
The book claims you can get food, sleep etc. in huts known as refugios. We
shunned this options, mostly because we had the tent etc. and we didn't fancy
booking ahead. One hears mixed reports about the quality of the places, how
watertight they are etc.
</p>

<h3>Day One</h3>

<p> We headed up on the ski lift from Villa Catedral (this is the primary
route in the book) mostly due to the parties of Argentine teenagers
heading for the path up to Refugio Frey. We were warned about the wind
at the bottom. It was a cold strong wind, but we were pretty stable
on our feet when we were up there. We did end up wearing thick gloves,
balaclava, many layers etc. Only one lift at the ski centre was operating,
so we took that one and had to figure out where we were at the top.  </p>

<p> We did the traverse from the ridge above the ski center to the
turning for Refugio Frey This is mostly over shattered rock, following
the dots. There were good views over the ridge at a low point. The turn
off to Frey (the left) and Jacob (the right) was drawn on a rock.  </p>

<p>
The book suggests dropping down to Frey, then climbing back up and down the
other side the next day. We shunned this option. It featured a pile more height
gain and loss, Megan (who we had met while white water rafting) described her
night there as an effort to hold the tent down in the wind, and we didn't fancy
hanging around with tons of teenagers.
</p>

<p> Its worth noting that the trek had quite a few parties of folk
in different levels of gear. We saw folk in trainers, without rain
protection.  Slow progress down to the valley - long scree descent. We hit
a low point when Laura stepped in someone else's poop. A shame everyone
doesn't carry a plastic trowel. Camped in the valley - its a big site
along the path. We didn't see anyone else that night, but more folks
showed up when we went to bed. In the evening, three dogs came and sniffed
around. No idea how they got into the park. It was brass monkeys in the
valley.)(see Committee to Ascribe a Naval Origin to Everything)  </p>

<h3>Day Two</h3>

<p> This was a short day - and we had hopes for day three - we pulled
out of the end of the valley and over the pass to Refugio Jakob. The
descent is more on scree fields and pretty slow. If you like walking
over shattered rock, you can do the two tops here.</p>

<p> When we got down to the Refugio, they said that the high route
over to  Lag Negra by Cerro Inocentes and Cerro Navidad was closed
due to snow. This led to much  griping. We wandered up to a high lake
(and wonderful corrie coated in snow) to peer at the next day's route. It
looked  good to us.  We had peered at the route from the other side of the
valley, and were unconvinced by their concerns. We restrained ourselves
from sneaking off at 6am, and planned to do a extra day walking out and
walking in the next valley.  </p>


<h3>Day Three</h3>

<p>
Foiled, we headed down the valley. This is a bit slow to get started, but
once over the bridge, we bombed it down the valley. Its a nice gentle
slope. However, its longer than the book says. (the book claims 13k, and
the sign at the bottom claims 18k, and the sign is a good bit closer). Its a
nice walk in the trees, but its nothing like as good as the ridge would have
been.
</p>

<p> We hitched from the bottom almost to Colonia Suiza. As we walked
the last mile or so, we could hear a very long rock and roll guitar
solo. This kept on playing for about forever.  We pitched up at a big
camp site somewhat more used to holidaying Buenos Aries folks than smelly
hikers. I almost fainted. We ate massive burgers and drank wine. This
is the life.  </p>

<h3>Day Four</h3>

We were slow getting off the next day, mostly because we had lost
motivation due to the massive detour and missing out on an awesome
ridge. At least the village gave us the opportunity to get rid of rubbish
which has to be carried out. Then we picked up some left by others.It
grates on me to see such spectacular places marred by human waste. I did
jump in the lake off the pier, which was fantastic. I think we should
carry swimming stuff. The camp site showers didn't work. We ate lunch
in the town before getting back on the hoof. The walk up the valley was
hot and full of flies. There really isn't much to say about it. Just
lots of forest, lots of pesky flies, and lots of other walkers.  </p>

<p> The end of the day was probably the toughest uphill of the walk -
a 400m pull up by the waterfall. Slow slow progress with the heavy
packs. The location of La Negra refugio is fantastic. Its on the
rocks by a high lake, above a massive waterfall. The rocky sides of
Cerro Negra tower above.  We camped in a hollow in the bushes. There
were many such hollows - no one is brave enough to camp in the open.
Laura shunned pasta, ate cold pizza leftover from lunch, and woke up at
4am in a hunger. Considering how bad the pasta was, this might have been
the better route. If you have suggestions of camping dinners other than
soup, pasta and sauce please send them on!  </p>

<h3>Day Five</h3>

<p> This was by far the best day. We went around the lake (which is harder
than it looks, and features hanging off dodgy bits of fixed rope), up to
the ridge on the far side, and along to the top of Cerro Bailey Willis
(1850m). The views from up here are fantastic. The speedy Israeli bloke
cut under the summit, and you can do that too (He seemed to to the same as
us until the top of Pico Turista, then he when back to the Refugio). We
dropped down to a col on the ridge, then headed to the top of a valley
where there is a camp site. </p>

<p>That was the first half of the day. From then on it got harder. We
headed up Pico Turista, about a 400 meters climb up a very steep scree chute. Going
was slow and unpleasant. We then went right down the other side, climbing down loose
rock. This was slow going, and the massive bags didn't help.  </p>

<p>
It was a slow 400m of vertical descent down to Refugio Lopez. Once there, it was about 8pm. The
Refugio was full of scouts. We wanted to stop here, but the book suggested
camping lower down, further from the wind and on green grass. Sadly, when we
got down to the area suggested, it was a bog. And not even a flat blog. We were
also pursued by a fox down to the area (which was maybe 200m below the Refugio
Lopez). We figured the fox wanted dinner, so we kept on moving.
</p>

<p>


The map showed another campsite then another Refugio called La Roca below
Lopez. We went down miles of 4x4 track (which was massive switchbacks)
until we turned up at a restaurant and asked for two beds and dinner. The
Netherlands-Argentine couple explained it was a restaurant and had
never heard of the mythical La Roca refugio. We were persuaded to eat
but as it got darker fortunately they allowed us to camp outside the
restaurant which we very much appreciated. There was a great view
and no electricity. The waitress told us what food they had and we
ordered almost all of it. The hunger had set in. Four empanadas, a pie,
a pizza and a salad, followed by dessert. She said áºƒow you are really
hungry!' We explained we had been walking for 5 days.  More here. A long
(12 hours of walking) and tough day.  </p>


<h3>Day Six</h3>

<p> We had coffee and a chat with the restaurant owners which was
interesting.  It turns out that only about 30% of Argentines have
official jobs and pay tax.  Most don't have bank accounts. We then
walked out along the switchbacks - this wasn't far, but we don't know
how far - and back to Colonia Suiza. Laura saw Magellanic woodpeckers
along the way. We aimed to appear on ruta 79 as close to Colonia Suiza
as possible, and we popped out on a road with private property notices
all over it. Oops. No one hassled us. The bus back to Bariloche was the
final straw - we waited 50 minutes past the time, then got lunch, then
went back and waited some more, all with no sign of the bus. In the end
we got a taxi. And then steak. Massive steak. We wore the same clothes
for 5 and half days and we are sorry for whoever washed them for us.  </p>
