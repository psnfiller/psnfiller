title: Nahuel Huapi Traverse
---

<p>
We are back from the Nahuel Huapi traverse. Its been a tough six days, and now
we are completely shattered and drinking lots of water. Also everything stinks.
I have this fear we'll be kicked out of the hostel due to the smell. Here are
some notes on the route, which might be of use to others.
</p>

<p>
Maps and stuff: we used the lonely planet book trekking in the patagonian
andes. The times in the book are optimistic. Speculation as to why:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> The author retired from the SAS, or some other job that required running
  up hills.</li>
  <li>The author wasn't carrying a test, food, stove, etc.</li>
  <li>The author was in the process of writing a book on patagonian treks and
  was therefore somewhat fitter than us.</li>
  <li> The author had spent the past few years working as a mountain guide.</li>
</ul>


<p>
I like the first theory, though the last two have the advantage of being true.
</p>

<p>
The map was kinda crappy too. Crags aren't marked. I suppose that if you want a
map with crags they start with a black bit of paper.
The nav was pretty easy though the trip, but mostly because we could see the way
owing to good weather. It would be a pain to do in poor weather.
</p>

<p>
A note to people choosing which treks to do . if you a trek without bureacracy
and health and safety stuff, unfortunately I would advise you to go somewhere
else. We got contradictory information about conditions for day 3 in Bariloche.
The national park office told us we needed a guide. We did not like this. We
also saw a guide in trainers. Club Andino Bariloche (CAB) who run most of the
refugios told us day 3 was technical. We quizzed them further and it turned out
that you can just go and don´t need ropes although there is scrambling. So we
thought we´d go and see what happened. Refugio Jakob wanted to know all about us
and where we were going and insisted that the traverse for day 3 was closed. We
debated options but decided to play it safe and head down a long valley and then
all the way back up the next day. This served to drain our motivation. The
valley is very pleasant but we had to lose 800m of height gain, add an extra day
and the aim was to get high and stay high.
</p>

<p>
We drank the water from the rivers. It was lovely and freezing cold. We often
had our cups on the outside of our bags, and dipped them into streams. We passed
a gang of scouts singing the spanish version of "I want to go awandering". Thats
our life now. Drinking water from streams, singing kids, green trees, Lewis and
Clark wandering past, foxes barking.
</p>

<p>
In less good water news, the folks down in CAB suggested added a drop of bleach
to each liter of water.
</p>

<p>
The book claims you can get food, sleep etc. in huts known as refugios. We
shunned this options, mostly because we had the tent etc. and we didn't fancy
booking ahead. One hears mixed reports about the quality of the places, how
watertight they are etc.
</p>

<h3>Day One</h3>

<p>
We headed up on the ski lift from Villa Catedral (this is the primary route in
the book) mostly due to the parties of Argentine teenagers heading for the path
up to Refugio Frey. We were warned about the wind at the bottom ýn´t want to go
up there, it´s windy and exposed. ´What is this health and safety nonsense
around here. I thought South America was suppposed to be the land of freedom and
unclimbed peaks. If we had wanted bureacracy and health and safety we would have
gone to England. It was a cold strong wind, but we were pretty stable on our
feet when we were up there. We did end up wearing thick gloves, balaclava, many
layers etc. Only one lift at the ski centre was operating, so we took that one
and had to figure out where we were at the top.
</p>

<p>
We did the traverse from the ridge above the ski center to the turning for
Refugio Frey This is mostly over shattered rock, following the dots. There was
good views over the ridge at a low point. The turn off to frey (the left) and
(Jacob the right) was drawn on a rock.
</p>

<p>
The book suggests dropping down to Frey, then climbing back up and down the
other side the next day. We shunned this option. It featured a pile more height
gain and loss, Megan (who we had met while white water rafting) described her
night there as a effort to hold the tent down in the wind, and we didn't fancy
hanging around with tons of teenagers.
</p>

<p>
Its worth noting that the trek had quite a few parties of folk in different
levels of gear. We saw folk in trainers, without rain protection, etc more here.
slow progress down to the valley - long scree descent. Camped in the valley -
its a big site along the path. We didn't see anyone else that night, but more
folks showed up when we went to bed. In the evening, three dogs came and sniffed
around. No idea how they got into the park. It was pretty cold in the valley.
</p>

<h3>Day Two</h3>

<p>
This was a short day - and we had hopes for day three - we pulled out of the end
of the valley and over the pass to ref... the descent is more on scree fields
and pretty slow. if you like walking over shattered rock, you can do the two
tops here.

<h3>day three</h3>


<p>
Foiled, we headed down the valley. This is a bit slow to get started, but
once over the bridge, we bombed it down the valley. Its a nice gentle
slope. However, its longer than the book says. (the book claims 13k, and
the sign at the bottom claims 18k, and the sign is a good bit closer). Its a
nice walk in the trees, but its nothing like as good as the ridge would have
been.
</p>

<p>
We hitched from the bottom almost to Colonia Suiza. As we walked the last
mile or so, we could hear a very long rock and roll guitar solo. This kept
on playing for ... We pitched up at a big campsite somewhat more used to
holidaying beanos aries folks than smelly hikers. I almost fainted. We ate
massive burgers and drank wine. This is the life.
</p>


<h3>Day Four</h3>

We were slow getting off the next day, mostly because we had lost
motivation. I did jump in the lake off the pier, which was fantastic. I
think we should carry swimming stuff. The camp-site showers didn't work. We
ate lunch in the town before getting back on the hoof. The walk up the
valley was hot and full of flies.
</p>

<p>
The end of the day was probably the toughest uphill of the walk - a 400m
pull up by the waterfall. Slow slow progress. The Location of La Negra is
fantastic. We camped in a hallow in the bushes. There were many such hollows- no
one is brave enough to camp in the open.  Laura shunned pasta, ate cold
pizza, and woke up at 4am in a hunger. Considering how bad the pasta was, this
might have been the better route.
</p>

<h3>Day Five</h3>

<p>
We went around the lake (which is harder than it looks, and features hanging
off dodgy bits of fixed rope), up to the ridge on the far side, and along to the
top of Cerro Bailey Willes. The views from up here are fantastic. The speedy
Israeli bloke cut under the summit, and you can do that too (He seemed to to the
same as us until the top of Pico Turista, then he when back to the Refugio). We
dropped down to a col on the ridge, then headed to the top of a valley where
there is a camp-site. </p>

<p>That was the first half of the day. From then on it got harder. We
headed up Pico Turista, about a 400 meters climb up a scree shoot. Going
was slow. We then when right down the other side, climbing down loose
rock. This was slow going, and the massive bags didn't help.  </p>

<p>
It was a slow 400m down to Refugio Lopez. Once there, it was about 8pm. The
Refugio was full of scouts. We wanted to stop here, but the book suggested
camping lower down, further from the wind and on green grass. Sadly, when we
got down to the area suggested, it was a bog. And not even a flat blog. We were
also pursed by a fox down to the area (which was maybe 200m below the Refugio
Lopez). We figured the fox wanted dinner, so we kept on moving.
</p>

<p>


The map showed another campsite then another Refugio below Lopez. We went down
miles of 4x4 track (which was massive switchbacks) until we turned up at a
restaurant. More here. A long (12 hours of walking) and tough day.
</p>


<h3>Day Six</h3>

<p> We had coffee and a chat with the restaurant owners, and we then
walked out along the switchbacks - this wasn't far, but we don't know how
far - and back to Colonia Suiza. Laura saw woodpeckers along the way. We
aimed to appear on route 79 as close to Colonia Suiza as possible, and we
popped out on a road with private property notices all over it. Oops. No
one hassled us. The bus back to Bariloche was the final straw - we waited
50 minutes past the time, then got lunch, then went back and waited some
more, all with no sign on the bus. In the end we got a taxi. And then
steak. Massive steak.  </p>
