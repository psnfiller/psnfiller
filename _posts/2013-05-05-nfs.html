<p>Many years ago, I started using a 10/100MBit ethernet switch at home. At the
time, gigabit switches were about 5-10x as expensive, and it didn't seem worth
it. After all, spinning disks in ideal usage do about 100MBit, and I couldn't
imagine that I'd end up wanting to go from RAM to RAM on two different machines. </p>

<p>Anyway. I've been copying SD cards from our trip to Utah from my laptop
(which has a SD port) to my file server.
<a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/iftop/">iftop</a> pointed to the reason
the copies were taking a while - I was saturating my switch. Upgrading to
gigabit was pretty cheap, so I did that. I suspect that this will double
throughput, because the file server (which is a raid5 array of disks) is at about
55% io usage.<p>

<p>Anyway. I was just surprised that I've finally hit that bottleneck. And that
waiting for prices to come down has paid off. Yey.</p>
