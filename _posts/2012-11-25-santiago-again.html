We are back in Santiago, where the internet flows freely and there is an
English-speaking church full of welcoming people. We are having a rest day, and
will be on the bus tomorrow to go to Mendoza in Argentina. The great thing about
having working internet is we can upload some photos, links below.

The flight out of Easter Island was somewhat amusing. We hauled down the tent,
then hauled our stuff to the airport (which looked like airports the world over,
with the exception of a pile of island-este artwork). When we checked in - a
process of signing many many releases for our baggage, they explained the flight
was delayed for four hours. This explanation was communicated by giving us a
pile of lunch vouchers. It turns out that the rules of the air (namely, feed
people when delayed) apply even if one is on a small volocano in the south
pacific. Other rules that seem to apply include drinking all water before
getting on plane. Rules that get ignored include removing all metal from pockets
before going though the detector.

Since the airport is a runway and a large shed, we were whisked off to a place
in town for lunch at the expense of LAN. Said place had not had their delivery
of food for the day. The sole thing they offered was garlic prawns. Pause. We
could not imagine why they were on the menu to begin with. We clearly saw why
they were the only things that the diners last night had not eaten. We worried
about being on a plane for many hours with large numbers of people who had all
eaten garlic prawns. We did not worry about vampires. We did worry about food
poisoning. The waitress saw our faces and said they also had some smoked salmon.
Saved!

The last couple days on the island were fun. We took a boat out around the sea
stack Motu Kau Kau and another two <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motu_Nui">islands</a>. We saw Masked Boobys
and Great Frigatebirds. It was wonderful but  many other species of seabirds
once nested on the islands so it was also a reminder of the consequences of
unsustainable exploitation and overgrazing among other ecological issues.

We tromped up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rano_Kau">Rano Kau</a>, an
old volcano with the ceremonial village <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orongo">Orongo</a> on the top. The view
into the crater is like looking at another landscape altogether. The village
consists of many restored stone buildings, which reminded me of <a

On the last night we found ourselves in a small restaurant which a couple at the
campsite suggested. Turns out this place had a giant barbeque. We found
ourselves stuffed with only a few bites... on average we're eating about two
meals a day, partly due to the heat, partly due to lack of need for more. The
way we wash our clothes has also changed:
