<p><b>Warning</b> More nerd content. </p>

<p>I found myself typing this (and the post before it) over <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty</a> (Note for the more twitchy - Strong encryption is legal in England (where is computer is) and Chile and Argentina. The list of countries that outlaw strong encryption is pretty similar to the list of countries with records of making citizens vanish.) Putty does not understand ssh keys in whatever format openssh uses. I dare not dig deeper. Having a system where I download a ssh key onto a untrusted machine is not wise. Having a system where I enter a password into a untrusted machine also is not wise</p>

<p>To deal with this, I set up <a
  href="http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/wiki/PamModuleInstructions">Google
  authenticator</a> for pam. This works pretty well so far - on a trusted
machine, I can continue to use ssh keys, and on a untrusted machine, I can use
the same one time systm as I use for email etc. I also have rescue codes in my
pocket incase I lose my phone.</p>
