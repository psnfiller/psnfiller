title: South of Punta Arenas

<p>
Punta Arenas is an odd town. It seems to forget its
at the end of the world, and looks inwards on itself.
Its a sprawling grid of statues, city driving, casinos, hotels,
civic history plaques, seaside promenade, cycle tracks, tanks, tooting horns,
horrendous looking nightclubs, massive shopping centers and the other trappings
of a big city. Perhaps there is a reason for all that.
We rented a car and headed south.
</p>

<p>

To the south ruta 9 runs through  forests and over bog. Rusting boats
are pulled up on the beach.  Wind battered, shambolic buildings scarcely
dot the landscape. Grey clouds swirl above, and the grey Magellan strait
stretches out.  On the horizon, the far side can be seen. Toward the
Pacific, the white of the last of the snow stands clear on mountains on
both sides.  Apart from the mountains, it reminds me of the Hebrides. The
Strait is much wider than I expected.  </p>

<p> We pulled off the road at Fuerte Bulnes. This is where the first
Chileans came.  They sailed down from Chiloe, stuck up a flag, and claimed
the Strait of Magellan. A replica fort stands on the spot. We wandered
around the empty wood and peat buildings, peered at the rusting cannons,
and looked out to sea. From the site, the far side of the water is a
maze of grey islands drifting in and out of the fog. There is not much
at the fort. We drove away.  The first settlers left as well - they had
picked a site without any water and a lot of wind.  </p>

<p> Up the road, we paused at the middle of Chile monument. This is half
way between Arica and the South pole.  Chile includes its Antarctic
claim on all maps. The 2002 census proclaimed 130 Chileans living on
Antarctica proper, and optimistically proclaims it a rural region.  </p>

<p> Down another road, we found Puerto Hambre, another attempt to live on
the side of the strait.  Spanish settlers came here in 1584 and founded
the port. The plan was to deny the straits to the English pirates who
were raiding their pacific ports.  In 1587, the English captain Thomas
Cavendish stopped there, to find everyone dead of starvation. He renamed
the place Port Famine.  There is nothing at the side now but an odd
marker. In the bay, there are many tied up fishing boats.  The local
shellfish have a disease, resulting in many many warning signs and the
odd dead tourist.  </p>

<p>
Further south, we stopped at a memorial to Phillip Parker King, then the
grave of Captain Pringle Stokes,
the first captain of the HMS Beagle. Both came here to survey the Strait.
Pringle Stokes committed suicide.
Sat down below the grave on a massive bit of driftwood. Stared out at the
water.
Waves hissed onto the beach. Clear water, stones at the bottom.
The odd shell. A squall splatters down.
</p>

<p>
Over the Rio San Pedro, the road became impassable for a normal car, so we
walked.
At the end of the road, there is a bullet-pocked sign proclaiming Cabo
Froward,
the end of the landmass, to be another 38k. We walked out on the beach for a
bit.
A long strip of seaweed on in the water. Only our footprints in the sand. The
beach is clean.
The woods come right down to the shore.
</p>

<p>
On the way back, the sun came out. The water is green close in and blue
further away.
We are going to see penguins tomorrow. Back in the Office in a week or so.
