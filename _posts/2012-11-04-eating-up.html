<p>
Laura pointed out to me last night that we have been eating up bits of food (so
we don't have to throw it away when we go) since we got back from <a

and <a

Thats something like five weeks of eating. worrying. However, we have made ribs
twice. Recipe is tasty and easy:
<ul>
  <li>3 spring onions, white part only, finely sliced</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
  <li>2 Garlic cloves, crushed</li>
  <li>1 teasppon wholegrain mustard</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon chilli paste</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce.</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons mango chutney.</li>
  <li>&frac12; sea salt</li>
  <li>&frac14; black pepper</li>
  <li>125ml Coopers pale ale</li>
  <li>2 racks of american style ribs (600-700g)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Its really easy to make. combine everything but the ribs together in a bowl -
this part smells pretty bad. Cut up the ribs into eatable sizes and stick
them in a deep tray. Pour the marinate over the ribs and leave. The book says
for a hour or two, but we normally leave them for a day. Stick them on the oven
at a low heat for a hour or so, then grill them. Avoid comments from Laura about
the lack of salad, veg, etc.
