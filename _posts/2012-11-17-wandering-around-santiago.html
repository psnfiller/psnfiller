<p>
We have been in Santiago for about two days now. In real terms, this is the end
of our stay. We had assumed we would conk out due to jetlag, but that has not
really happened _ I think this is due to the time difference being pretty small
- only three hours - and due to us being tired enough to sleep on the flight.
We are staying at a lovely hostel in
Jetlag
