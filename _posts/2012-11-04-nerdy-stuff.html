I'm a nerd. Here's some nerdy notes.

</p>
Cameras: I'm planning to take my point and shoot. its maybe a year old. Its
grand. Now the bad news is that I can take a lot of photos - over 100 a day. So
amazon sent us 10 8g sd cards. Betcha we still run out. Betcha that I look at
the idea of only 80g of storage and laugh. I've also bought space on
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/102479403334301156799">Picsa</a> which was
dead cheap. The hope there is that we'll be able to get the orginals back though
