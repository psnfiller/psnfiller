I'm a nerd. Here's some nerdy notes.

</p>
Cameras: I'm planning to take my point and shoot. its maybe a year old. Its
grand. Now the bad news is that I can take a lot of photos - over 100 a day. So
amazon sent us 10 8g sd cards. Betcha we still run out. Betcha that I look at
the idea of only 80g of storage and laugh. I've also bought space on
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/102479403334301156799">Picsa</a> which was
dead cheap. The hope there is that we'll be able to get the orginals back though <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout">takeout</a> later. Facebook is much more of a pain in this respect. We've also got some blank cds, which we'll try and back stuff up onto. The fear here is both losing / damaging a SD card, and also theft.

We'll probably want to get into email and facebook while
we're out there. We'll probably do it from internet
cafes with interesting collections of malware. So <a

factor</a> and <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150172618258920">SMS
auth</a>. SMS auth is a bit more of a pain as we don't really know phone
numbers out there - experience and common sense argues for buying a new
sim card. I've also picked up a
<a href="http://www.yubico.com/yubikey">yubikey</a> for
<a href="https://lastpass.com/">lastpass</a>. We'll probably still have
problems.
</p>

<p>

I'm taking a android phone, and to reduce the impact of it being lost or
stolen I've set up the android / google apps corp system for registering
phones <a href="https://www.google.com/apps/mydevices">the control
panel</a> Lets you ring phones, wipe phones remotely and tells you where
they are. Its a google apps for your domain feature that actually costs
money, but its pretty cheap. And it means I never loose my phone again. I Aslo set
up the normal security settings - encrypting the phone and so on. We'll see.
