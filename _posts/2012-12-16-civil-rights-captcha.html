<p><b>Warning - nerdy content</b> I spent a lazy afternoon back in Dublin
pulling apart Civil rights captcha, and I wanted to save my notes by
sticking them on the blog.  </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Civil rights captcha is a system that aims to educate people on civil rights as
well as tell humans from robots.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/">The site.</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/10/empathy-captcha/">Wired article</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4619248">Hacker news thread</a>
</ul>

<p>Note that wired and therefore hacker news talk about filtering out internet
idiots with this, which isn't mentioned on their site.</p>


<h2>how secure is this?</h2>

<p> First idea - they only have a few questions. I think each question
takes a human to come up with it and review it.They can't really raise
civil rights awareness with a incorrect collection of ills and they
don't want to be sued for libel.  </p>

<p>
Download the page 1000 times.
</p>
<pre>
for x in {0..1000}; do
  curl -s -o dataset/$x captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org
  done
</pre>

<p>
Compare them to one another.
</p>

<pre>
for x in dataset/*; do
  diff dataset/0 $x | egrep '>'
done | sort | uniq > questions
</pre>
<p>
They have given 8 questions. Theories as to why:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>they only have 8 questions.</li>

  <li>they shard questions by IP or user agent. For example, they might
  only give curl users 8 questions.</li>
</ul>

 <p>
They might also have many correct answers per question. With a normal captcha you
only have one correct answer.
</p>


<p>
How many answers are there? Use chrome to grab a image url. Use curl to hit that
url a few times. Each file has a different sha1sum (it would be nice to have a
command line tool that uses a cheaper hash), so possibly a bug in the
loop or a different image. Download 1000 images.
</p>

<pre>
mkdir images
for x in {0..10000}; do
  curl -s -o images/$x 'http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/captchaAPI/securimage_show.php?sid=xJZNm2G1mK5TQQH69mX3&newset=7&lang=en';
done
</pre>

<p>
Hash all the images, see 1003 different hashes. Ideas:
<ul>
  <li>different words</li>
  <li>different lines over each word.</li>
  <li>some sort of salting in the image to defeat hashing</li>
  <li>bug in the loop.</li>
</ul>
</p>

 <p>
Look at the images. Lots of different words, some negative, some positive. Some
dupe words, but not many. Download 6k images. All of them are different.
</p>

 <p>

Peer at chrome's debugger. Watch the process. The javascript fetches one image with
newset=1, and two more without the newset parameter. Each request has
a sid parameter set to a random string. The random string is different
for each image. The newset request sets a cookie, which is sent back to
the server. Example cookie:

</p>

<pre>
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=eq0llt1rjtfr0h3fa0mlorrm67; path=/
</pre>

 <p>
Random string notes: its not clear what purpose the random string serves. If I
had to guess, it prevents http caching.
</p>

 <p>
Once the user enters a answer, it does validation with a request like so.
</p>

<pre>
curl --cookie 'PHPSESSID=e66bfeidg9ukm1ovvk9cn1i8f6'
'http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/captchaAPI/?callback=jQuery1&code=concerned'
</pre>


result:

<pre>
jQuery1({"answer":"false"});
</pre>

 <p>
So it presumably stores a map of session to correct answer on the server side,
and returns a json blob if the user's input is correct.
</p>

<p>Code for a session</p>

<pre>
set -eux
session_id=$RANDOM
dir=session-$session_id
mkdir $dir
random=$(printf "%06daaaaaaaaaaaaaa" $session_id)
curl -s -o $dir/1.png --dump-header $dir/1.headers
"http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/captchaAPI/securimage_show.php?sid=${random}&newset=1&lang

cookie=$(awk '/Set-Cookie:/{print $2}' session/1.headers | tr -d ';')
awk '/Set-Cookie:/{print $2}' $dir/1.headers
curl --cookie "$cookie" -s -o $dir/2.png --dump-header $dir/2.headers "http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/captchaAPI/securimage_show.php?sid=${ra
curl --cookie "$cookie" -s -o $dir/3.png --dump-header $dir/3.headers "http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/captchaAPI/securimage_show.php?sid=${ra

echo $dir
echo 'work out the answer'
read answer

curl -s --dump-header $dir/answer.headers --cookie "$cookie" "http://captcha.civilrightsdefenders.org/captchaAPI/?callback=jQuery1&code=${answer}"
</pre>

<h3>Can this be brute forced?</h3>

 <p>
Start out by sending the contents of /usr/share/dict/british-english
</p>

<pre>
% wc -l /usr/share/dict/british-english
99156 /usr/share/dict/british-english
</pre>

 <p>
It takes 30s to test 100 words. So to test british-english would take
8 hours.  New plan: find a list of words for emotions on the internet. <a
  href="http://www.derose.net/steve/resources/emotionwords/ewordsRanked.txt">like
  so</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>~700 words, so under 5m to test them all. Doesn't work.</li>


  <li>How about solving the captcha, verifying it, then sending 10
  verify requests for random words, then trying to verify the correct
  answer again? Fails.</li>

  <li>How about trying a random word, then trying the correct answer?
  Fails.</li>

  <li>How about trying the correct answer twice? Works both times.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>
Even though the key space is quite small, O(100)s of words, brute forcing
is hard because any false answer drops the session.  </p>

 <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>


This is more robust than I expected. A lot of the attacks I expected
to work don't work. There are fairly few questions, but the questions
don't matter. There are O(100s) of text answers, but its generating a new
image for each request, meaning that there isn't any point in solving the
images offline (or spending time trying to use their site as a oracle
for the images).  It reduces down to the normal image captcha problem -
OCRing images online. Its also probably vulnerable to dos attacks on
opening many sessions.  </p>

<p>Post-script: actually reading their docs shows that its based on <a
href="http://www.phpcaptcha.org/">php captcha</a>.</p>
