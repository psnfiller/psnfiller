title: Island of Penguins
---


<p>
We rolled out of bed a bit before 6am today and set off to Isla Magdalena.
When we got there, there were Magellanic penguins.
Hundreds of thousands of them (estimates range from 150,000 - 300,000). Penguins
sleeping,
penguins grooming, penguins kicking up dust, penguins maintaining nests,
penguins waddling around, penguins telling off their kids,
penguins calling, penguins preening  and penguins engaged in various forms of pair
bonding.
One had built his home on the path,
and pecked tourists who interfered with his construction.
Laura, as you can imagine, was in seventh heaven. Penguins swimming are lighting
fast
and nothing at all like the waddling penguins on land. There were a lot of Kelp
gulls too
and a few dead chicks. Other species included Chilean skuas and Rock Cormorants.

Next stop was Isla Marta where we could not land but were able to see sea lions
and more
bird species. The smell and noise! A fantastic wildlife experience. We went with
Solo
Expediciones and they were grand. They have a real tank of a boat and it
ploughed through
 the waves quickly, water lashing against the windows.

 Next stop Puerto Williams, Isla Navarino, still in Chile. 30 hour ferry ride.
 Glad to be leaving Punta
 Arenas town!
