<p>We're off to chile!</p>

<p>
Background: we've been talking about taking a chunk of time off. Its a good time
for both me and laura to take time off work, so now is the moment.  We were
talking about going to New Zealand and Australia, but we found photos of Patagonia on the internet, and our minds were set.

We've away for 3 months, going to Chile and Angentina. We have a flight into
Santiago and another one out of Buenos Aires three months later. We'll see what
happens in between ;-).

We're going to move out of our flat in Dublin - Its a nice place, but it needs
some work, and the only way that work will happen is if the landlord has to rent
it to some other sucker. We're going though all our Stuff, sticking it in boxes,
and getting in in Storage. Its remarkable how stuff accumulates if you aren't
moving all the time.

We've bought a tent, thanks to Dave. Its very nice, and weighs about nothing. We hauled it down to Galtymore, <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102479403334301156799/albums/5804324042094533681">(see photos)</a> where we froze to death. Worrying.
