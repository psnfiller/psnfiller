title: I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous
---

<p> We have seen glaciers before. I think the first time for me was in
Canada. We visited a closed viewpoint in Banff national park. We waded
though waist deep snow to peer down on a very blue lake and the grey ice
below. Snow was all around, and heavy clouds hung over us. The white of
the snow and the grey of the rock is all I recall seeing of the glacier
and the ice field beyond. It was cold.  We had a way to drive before
night and snow fall. The first time Laura tried to turn the car, it
slid off the snow covered road and into a gentle snowbank.  We turned
away from the glacier. Perhaps its more spectacular in summertime, when,
you know, its actually open for viewing.  </p>

<p> School had a photo of a glacier in France. It looks muddy and was
a odd grey-brown colour. Each year a field trip visited it. School had
a collection of photos taken from  the same spot, year after year. Each
year it had retreated many meters.  These days I assume the glacier has
retreated out of shot. One day it will be gone altogether. Needless to
say, this makes me a bit sad.  </p>


<p> Perito Moreno is nothing like these. A massive white wall of ice
advancing over the valley, it seems otherworldly. It is impossible to
fit it all in. Behind the leading wall, the glacier and the ice field
behind it stretch to the horizon. Up close, one watches spires of ice
fall silently until they hit the water. The boom of impact echoes from
the mountains. Enormous cracking noises, like a giant standing on a frozen
sea, come from deep within the glacier as it crawls forward. Icebergs bob
in the milky water. Semi circles of ice come out from the edge - marking
places where the glacier has calved off more chunks.  Peering into the
cracks, one sees a deep blue white colour, suggesting a impossible maze
of chasms and fractures.
</p>


<p> The glacier has crawled down out of the Andes. It has hit two
problems - a mountain, and a large river. The glacier crawls out into
the river. After many months, it reaches the other side and blocks
the river. Neither the ice nor the water can erode the mountain fast
enough. The water level rises until the pressure undercuts the glacier,
leading the river to flow under an arch in the ice.  After yet more time,
the arch, worn by the water and pressured by the weight of the ice,
cracks and explodes, leaving the river to run free once more.  </p>

<p> The only way of fully understanding the size of the glacier is
to take to the air.  The mountain, bigger than anything in Ireland,
in barely noticeable in the pictures. The river, large enough to have
a detachment of the Argentine navy (no, I don't know why or what they
were doing), shrinks on the postcard. The glacier, miles of cracks and
wrinkles covering its surface, looks like a unstoppable force, sent down
from the Andes to march, Sherman like, over the Patagonian steppe.  </p>

<p> Anyway. We have no photos because this whole town
gets it's internet by encoding bits into icebergs floating down <a

. The acks come back in the tourist copies of <i>In Patagonia</i>. If
you think the Mylodon is a metaphor for Chatwin's sanity, you are carrying a
