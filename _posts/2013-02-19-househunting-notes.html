<p>I wrote this a while ago, and we now have said yes to two places, and have
actually given money to one. </p>

<p> We went around to see two places tonight. The first place turned us
away - they had gone already. Laura talks about sleeping on picking a place,
but that is not going to happen. Some other guy would snap it up. People
rent with the speed and lack-of-care that normally connected to twitter
during a major event. Ireland, having decided contraception is okay, has
found another thing where snap choices lead to long term things. Anyway. Also,
Laura points out contraception has been legal for 20 years.
</p>

<p> Popped around to see the second place. Spent 10 minutes talking
nonsense on the step. The main topic was the landlord of the place we were
going to see. You see, on Saturday, we had spammed 13 different people about
their houses. Estate agents work much the same hours as everyone else,
so I was a bit surprised to get a reply at 1am. The only reason we knew
it was 1am was because we were on a internet binge, but that's another
story. He offered to show us the place on Sunday or Monday. Laura ended up
talking to him on the phone. He spoke very very quickly. He was determined to
get us around to see it right away. If he had a teleport, we would have been in
his living room before we knew it. We decided he drank tons of coffee - enough
to quicken his speech and keep him awake till the small hours.
Anyway, after 10 minutes or so, we called him up to find out where he
was. We imagined him in a caffeine crash. You can guess where he was.
</p>

<p> Place was nothing worth talking about. Tons of space. High
ceilings. Made up our minds pretty quickly, and chatted to the
landlord. The highlight of this was his suggestion that we would be
friendly and intimate. Now, I don't know who you think you are, but only
one guy gets to be intimate with my wife. Sorry about that. Another
gem was him talking about how the bills were low and it was a mild
night. Now, I was shivering and Laura could see her breath. Laura and I
have been talking about a "very mild" day thereafter. Less amusing was
his suggestion that Laura could do some gardening. If you want a gardener,
mate, get a gardener. As we left, he said that he did think the place
was a bit run down himself, and that "burglarys aren't a problem here,
fires are".
