<p> At work there is a web single sign on system. And it has the feature
that visiting a single page will log you out. This leads to people
setting up comedy redirects. I may have been one of these people. The
problem is called logout CSRF - and the folks who look after the system
say its working as expected. The  <a
  href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/">google
  app security reward program</a> explicitly calls
out logout CSRF
this as "Difficult, long-term browser-level improvements are required
to truly eliminate this possibility.".  </p>

<p>
CSRF is a simple attack. The user visits a malicious website. The source for that
website refers to a good website in either html or in JavaScript. The user's
browser runs the code and sends GET or POST requests to the good website. The
good website assumes the user is telling the browser to send the requests - for
example to transfer the money. This is the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">Confused deputy
  problem</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is a pretty well understood attack now. Most sites have defences, but the
logout hole lingers. Here's a example <a href="
  https://nuttall.im/wut-plus-plus.html">Don't click it!</a></p>

<p>I thought that this would be a fun thing to explore one weekend.
I threw together a pretty simple login system in python and <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a>. Quick
aside: web.py is lovely. The user logs in, and gets a cookie. For every user
action, the cookie is sent by the user browser, and validated. There's no server
side session stuff at all. When the user logs out, the cookie is deleted. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/psnfiller/auth">github</a>.

<p>Quick note on the cookie contents. The cookie contains the username,
the timestamp the cookie was generated at, the cookie expiry time,
and a <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">HMAC</a>.
  If a attacker changes any of the data in the cookie, the hamc is
  invalid. The attacker does not know the key for the HMAC, so can not generate
  a valid cookie.
</p>

<p>
Why store all the information  client side? The main reason is dos protection.

</p>

<p>Anyway, there are CRSF attacks in both the login and logout pages. For
logout, the evil site loads the logout url in a iframe. For login, the evil site
has javascript which submits the login form with a different username and
password. Code for both is in <a
  href="https://github.com/psnfiller/auth/tree/master/attacks">git</a> and live
on <a href="http://scandalous-stick-art.com/logout.html">another site.</a>
</p>

<p>
The defence  against CSRF is pretty well known - for every form
or url, include a hidden value that the attacker can't guess. Check
for the hidden value on every action. If its missing or corrupt, reject
the action.
</p>

<p>
I ended up using the user's IP, a timestamp, and a expiry time and a
hmac. The timestamp and expiry protect against replay attacks. The user's ip
protects against a attacker scraping the login form, getting a valid token, and
using it for the attack. Once again, the only server side state is the hmac key. </p>
</p>


<p>Clearly, all of this has to happen over https. Otherwise a passive attacker
can sniff the password or the cookie, and do what he wants. https also protects
against a active attacker from changing the requests or responses.</p>

<p>At this stage it seems things are pretty well protected - any user
action, including logout,  is tied to a token that  attacker can't
discover or fake.  So why doesn't Google protect against logout csrf? The
answer is in cookie bombardment and forcing. They worry about the case
where there is a active man in the middle attacking the user, and the user
is doing some other browsing while logged into gmail. The MitM can inject
or modify http requests and responses, but not gmail's https requests.
When the user requests a different site, the attacker can 302 them to the
http version of gmail, then can intercept the request for gmail, then can
reply with a cookie-clearing header. Volia, the user is logged out. </p>

<p>Cookies have grown two  features over the years to protect against different
attacks. secure and httpOnly. A HttpOnly cookie is only sent over the wire in a
http or https request, and can;t be accessed by javascript. A secure cookie is
only sent to a https url. However, a http page can set a cookie with the same
name as a secure cookie, and therefore overwrite the secure cookie. This is a
bug, in my opinion, and it lets a active attacker force a logout of a https only
site. </p>

<p>
The solution to this, in my mind, is HSTS. This is a header to tell the
browser that all traffic for a domain is over https. This prevents the
MitM from injecting a request over http, and therefore from injecting
cookies. Wee.
</p>

<p>
The next attack is cookie bombardment. The MitM starts sending lots of
cookies for unrelated sites. The browser's global limit on the number of
cookies it can store is reached. The browser starts evicting cookies. It
evicts the login cookie, logging the user out.
</p>

<p>
Its hard to tell how big a deal this is. The attacker can issue up to 20
redirects between different domains for each user http click. For each of
those domains, he can set 150 cookies with 4k of data each, which is 12M
of data. I haven't worked out what the limit is. My Cookies file is 700k.
</p>

<p>Anyway, at this point we've gone past a attacker tricking the user to click
on a url to a active attacker spraying cookies around. I figure the logout hole
should be closed a bit more than it is.</p>
