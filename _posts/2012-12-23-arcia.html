<p>Some non-nerdy content: we are in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica">Arica</a>, right at
the top of Chile. The hope had been to spend Christmas in  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauca_National_Park">Lauca National
Park</a>, but we haven't had any success hiring a car. We might spend
Christmas here, eating barbecue and sitting on the beach. This idea is
growing on me.
