<p>
We have been in Santiago for about two days now. In real terms, this is the end
of our stay. We had assumed we would conk out due to jetlag, but that has not
really happened _ I think this is due to the time difference being pretty small
- only three hours - and due to us being tired enough to sleep on the flight.
We are staying at a lovely hostel in the MORE district. Its a old building, full
of wood panelling. We don{t know what it was before it was a hostel - the guy on
the desk thinks it was a goverment building.

The Hostel is in a area full of car parts shops. Every single business seems
to be a car parts shop. No idea why. No one we are asked knows why.
